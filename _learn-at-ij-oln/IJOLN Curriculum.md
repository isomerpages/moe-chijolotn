They are also guided by developments within educational psychology and in particular that of positive psychology.</p><p>Furthermore, subject syllabi, regular professional networking and professional development opportunities ensure that staff understanding of subject matter and goals is current and sees transference to the IJ OLN classroom.</p><p><strong>EdTech Pedagogical Scaffold with its focus on Active Learning, Deep Learning</strong><br>The twin notions of active and deep learning feature centrally in The Framework, and is the aim of all learning experiences at IJ OLN. Through lessons incorporating active and deep learning, IJ OLN provides quality educational experiences to its students.</p><p>Active learning processes are incorporated in lesson planning, lesson enactment, assessment and feedback using the EdTech Pedagogical Scaffold with which teachers challenge themselves to think and rethink classroom interactions, and design effective learning experiences (with or without technology integration) that lead to deep learning. When engaged in deep learning, students think critically and communicate and work with others effectively across all subjects. Students learn to self-direct their own education and to adopt the learning dispositions and they learn to be lifelong learners.</p><p><strong>Teaching Approaches</strong> across subject disciplines, teachers design experiences that see:</p><ol data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Learning Supported by Technology</p></li><li><p>(Students) Learning Collaboratively</p></li><li><p>(Students) Learning within a Positive Environment</p></li><li><p>Learning enriched by Feedback</p></li></ol><p>These four teaching approaches are implemented on their own and in conjunction with one another.</p>
