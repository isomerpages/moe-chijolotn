#### Key Programmes
##### Lower Primary Mathematics Trail
The Mathematics trail is conducted for Primary 1 and 2 students to foster the practical application of Mathematics in everyday life. This interactive learning experience takes students on a trail around our school while solving mathematical questions. Students become active participants in their learning process. The Maths Trail not only sparks enthusiasm but also cultivates an appreciation for the relevance of Mathematics beyond the classroom.

##### Multiplication Challenge

The multiplication challenge is an event that makes multiplication enjoyable and foster teamwork among students. Students embark on a journey of fun and learning at four interactive stations. At each station, students encounter unique and engaging activities that test their multiplication skills. The activities include puzzles and peer challenges that are crafted to be entertaining and educational. By the end of the challenge, students sharpen their multiplication skills and experience the joy of learning in a collaborative setting.

##### Fibonacci Mathematics
This enrichment program is designed for students who exhibit a keen interest and exceptional proficiency in Mathematics. Its objective is to cultivate the students’ mathematical reasoning abilities and enhance their conceptual comprehension through an inquiry-based approach. Students collaborate with their peers and actively engage in mathematical thinking through puzzles, games and mathematical explorations.

##### Environmental Education in Mathematics
The integration of Environmental Education (EE) into Mathematics has proven beneficial in engaging students in problem-solving scenarios that reflect real-word situations. It enhances their comprehension of the interconnectedness between Mathematics and the environment. Through the integration of EE, students gain valuable insights into the practical applications of mathematical concepts. Students are encouraged to think critically and creatively, exploring how Mathematics can effectively address environmental challenges. In the lower primary level, students create ‘toys’ using recycled materials brought from home. This activity also allows students to identify the shapes they have learnt in their Mathematics lessons.
