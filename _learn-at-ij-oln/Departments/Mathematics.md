#### Key Programmes
##### Lower Primary Mathematics Trail
The Mathematics trail is conducted for Primary 1 and 2 students to foster the practical application of Mathematics in everyday life. This interactive learning experience takes students on a trail around our school while solving mathematical questions. Students become active participants in their learning process. The Maths Trail not only sparks enthusiasm but also cultivates an appreciation for the relevance of Mathematics beyond the classroom.
