#### English Language Department
##### Key Programmes: 
##### STELLAR (Strategies for English Language Learning And Reading) 

STELLAR is an interactive literacy programme that fosters confidence in learning English using children's literature. Through STELLAR, our students develop a love for learning and acquire a strong foundation in English. Additionally, meaning-making is strengthened with renewed emphasis on viewing and representing. This is further enhanced by engagement with rich multimodal perspectives. At CHIJ OLN, experiential and applied learning opportunities in the STELLAR classroom are also infused so as to enliven and inject joy in language learning.

##### Rich, Enduring and Active Learning (REAL)
REAL is a curriculum innovation unique to our school. REAL sparks a love for language with authentic, rich texts that create language-rich environments and enables students to appreciate language and issues beyond the classroom. There is also promotion of extensive reading to help students sharpen reading comprehension and narrative writing capabilities, and provision of discussion platforms to hone oracy. 

REAL sees engagement with Literature and in the process, develops critical thinking in students. In recent years, REAL has been integrated with our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) – Learn, Engage, Articulate &amp; Perform (LEAP).

##### Technology in Language Learning
We empower our students to leverage Technology as 
1. A tool to apply skills of verifying the accuracy, credibility and currency of information. For example, students use and curate digital evidence to support/explain their reasoning and decisions.
2. An enabler of peer interactions, synchronously and asynchronously, in the exploration and assessment of information and ideas.  
3. A means of exchanging feedback with peers and teachers to enhance deep and engaged learning. 
4. A partner in developing multiliteracies.

**Stretch Opportunities**<br>
The department has in place various opportunities and platforms to meet the needs of students who show greater aptitude and interest in the English Language.

* Within Curriculum
June Maker’s Model of Curriculum Differentiation for curriculum enrichment is applied to STELLAR classrooms where curriculum work is differentiated in Content, Process, Product and / or Learning Environment for the Verbal-Talented. 

  Curriculum Differentiation also factors in our REAL x LEAP curriculum enrichment where breadth and depth of reading and speaking experiences extend beyond the mainstream syllabus. Differentiated experiences to stretch students with greater aptitude or interest include, for example, exploring moral dilemmas in novels by appreciating and understanding multiple and conflicting perspectives. 
 
* Beyond Curriculum
Students with greater aptitude and interest are presented with authentic experiences beyond the classroom that further stretch them. Going beyond reading current affairs, they are challenge to respond to news by writing to the editor. 

  Furthermore, our students are encouraged to develop their language and literacy talents through participation in competitions such as The Royal Commonwealth Essay Competition and the Plain English Speaking Award (PESA). 

All in all, these stretch opportunities within and beyond the curriculum further develop empathy in learners, deepens creative expression skills, encourage meaningful meaning-making across new and different contexts, instils risk-taking and fosters courage in learners to engage a real-world audience with their unique voice.
