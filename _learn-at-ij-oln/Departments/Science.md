<h2><strong>Science Department</strong></h2><h3>Key Programmes</h3><h4>Science Projects</h4><p>Science projects provide a platform for students to enjoy learning Science and encourages curiosity. Through science projects, Primary 3 to Primary 5 students are given opportunities to pursue a topic that interests them and to demonstrate the ability to communicate scientific knowledge.</p><p>Students work in groups to choose suitable materials, design and present their experiment as well as the process they used to come up with a final product. In so doing, students exercise creativity, demonstrate responsibility and resilience as they develop ways to observe, collect evidence and construct explanations to support their evidence.</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/Sci/project1_w.jpg"></div></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/Sci/project3_w.jpg"></div></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/Sci/project2_w.jpg"></div></th></tr></tbody></table><h4>Outdoor Learning Experience</h4><p>Outdoor learning experiences provide opportunities for students to explore, discover and experience Science in everyday life. Through learning in a real-world context, students develop skills, dispositions, and attitudes for scientific inquiry. Our students also learn to appreciate how Science influences people and the environment. The outdoor learning experience @ IJ OLN includes the eco-garden trail, the Edible Garden and the Outdoor Learning Space (OEL). Our teachers design meaningful and purposeful lessons around these outdoor learning spaces to help students deepen their understanding of the subject matter. </p><p></p><p></p>
