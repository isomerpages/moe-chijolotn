<h2><strong>Science Department</strong></h2><h3>Key Programmes</h3><h4>Science Projects</h4><p>Science projects provide a platform for students to enjoy learning Science and encourages curiosity. Through science projects, Primary 3 to Primary 5 students are given opportunities to pursue a topic that interests them and to demonstrate the ability to communicate scientific knowledge.</p><p>Students work in groups to choose suitable materials, design and present their experiment as well as the process they used to come up with a final product. In so doing, students exercise creativity, demonstrate responsibility and resilience as they develop ways to observe, collect evidence and construct explanations to support their evidence.</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/Sci/project1_w.jpg"></div></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/Sci/project3_w.jpg"></div></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/Sci/project2_w.jpg"></div></th></tr></tbody></table><h4>Outdoor Learning Experience</h4><p>Outdoor learning experiences provide opportunities for students to explore, discover and experience Science in everyday life. Through learning in a real-world context, students develop skills, dispositions, and attitudes for scientific inquiry. Our students also learn to appreciate how Science influences people and the environment. The outdoor learning experience @ IJ OLN includes the eco-garden trail, the Edible Garden and the Outdoor Learning Space (OEL). Our teachers design meaningful and purposeful lessons around these outdoor learning spaces to help students deepen their understanding of the subject matter.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/Sci/oel3_w.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/Sci/oel1_w.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/Sci/oel2_w.jpg"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Einstein Programme</h4><p>As part of providing differentiated experiences for our students, the Einstein Programme is a science enrichment programme that seeks to nurture important 21st century competencies such as resilience and resourcefulness, critical and inventive thinking, and effective communication skills while it fosters the development of scientific inquiry skills among our students. Through collaborative work, students develop scientific thinking and reasoning through participating in Science experiments.</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/Sci/e2k2_w.jpg"></div></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/Sci/e2k_w.jpg"></div></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/Sci/e2k4_w.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/Sci/e2k3_w.jpg"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Concrete Learning Experiences</h4><p>Hands-on experiments are essential in a science classroom. Teachers engage students in hands-on experiments and help them understand how scientific knowledge is developed through inquiry. By ‘doing’, students are more participative and reflective. Since Science learning involves complex and abstract concepts, hands-on experiments provide concrete experiences that help our students grasp difficult ideas. To ensure that the students have ample opportunities to see science-in-action, the department has created additional experiments, beyond those found in the activity books.</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/Sci/exp_materials_w.jpg"></div></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/Sci/exp_mould_w.jpg"></div></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/Sci/exp_matter_w.jpg"></div></th></tr></tbody></table><h4>Environment Education</h4><p>Inspired by Pope Francis’ encyclical ‘Laudato Si’ on Care for Our Common Home and in alignment to the school’s Strategic Thrust 3 ‘Growing Engaged Citizens’, Environment Education @ IJ OLN commits to:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><strong>Building greater environmental awareness in the school community</strong></p></li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/Sci/assembly_w.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/Sci/assembly2_w.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/Sci/assembly3_w.jpg"></div></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="3"><p>&nbsp;Promoting environmental awareness through assembly programmes during GLOW mornings.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><strong>Encouraging a strong sense of civic responsibility in the school community through participation in conservation efforts</strong></p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/Sci/upcycling_w.jpg"></div></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/Sci/earthhour_w.jpg"></div></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Students learn about upcycling, such as by transforming an old t-shirt into a tote bag.</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>CHIJ Our Lady of the Nativity commemorates Earth Hour as a family.
