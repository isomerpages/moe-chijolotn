<p>The Character &amp; Citizen Education (CCE) Department oversees student
learning in the three main areas - Pastoral Care, National Education and
Student Leadership Development. At CHIJOLN, we believe in creating authentic
learning experiences to help each student develop in character, social-emotional
well-being, and citizenship dispositions.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h3>
<h4>CCE Lessons – CCE Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) and CCE Mother Tongue Languages (MTL)</h4>
<p>At CHIJ OLN, we believe that students’ learning would be optimized in
a caring school environment. This is done through building positive teacher-student
relationship (TSR) and student-student relationship (SSR).
<br>CCE (FTGP) allows teachers and students to interact and build relationships
while learning values, skills and knowledge through discussion of contexts
and case studies. In CCE (MTL), students deepen their values and citizenship
dispositions through discussion of social issues. They also learn to be
responsible to their family and community and understand their roles in
shaping the future of our nation.
<br>Peer support lessons such as help-seeking and help-giving skills are also
taught in CCE (FTGP). This seeks to cultivate peer support mindset and
skills in every student.</p>

<h4>Values-in-Action</h4>
<p>Values-in-Action (VIA) are learning experiences that support students'
development as socially responsible citizens. At CHIJ OLN, the VIA programme
encourages students to make a positive difference and emphasises compassion
and commitment to serve others, particularly the marginalised or disadvantaged.</p>
<p>Each level embarks on a project that will make a positive difference in
the lives of their family members, classmates, school and community levels.
Through the VIA programmes, students have opportunities to demonstrate
and apply their knowledge, skills and values and contribute meaningfully
to the community.</p>

<h4>National Education &amp; Social Studies Curriculum</h4>
<p>National Education aims to develop national cohesion, cultivate the instinct
for survival as a nation and instill in our students confidence in our
nation’s future. It also cultivates the necessary citizenship dispositions:
to have a sense of belonging, hope, reality and a will to act.</p>
<p></p>
<p>National Education is pervasively implemented in CHIJOLN through Social
Studies lessons, NE Commemorative Days, VIA activities and School Wide
Learning Journeys. Here are some examples of our NE Commemorative Days
activities in school:</p>

<h4>School Wide Learning Journeys</h4>
<p>To extend learning beyond the classroom and to provide all students with
opportunities to explore their Singaporean identity, all students will
participate in at least two learning journeys a year. Through pre-, during-
and post-visit experiences to museums, parks, trails etc, our students
make connections between what concepts, values and dispositions they are
taught and what they experience. Here are some examples of our School Wide
Learning Journeys:

<h4><strong>Cyber Wellness</strong></h4>
<p>Technology impacts students’ development in their learning and thinking.
We aim to help our students become responsible digital learners who will
be able to protect themselves, as they navigate the cyberspace.</p>
<p>The main platform for the delivery of cyber wellness lessons is through
CCE (FTGP) and Cyber Wellness week. Care Ambassadors are also trained to
promote the message of cyber wellness to their peers by giving presentations
and supporting the cyber wellness programmes in the school. It is also
augmented by work done by other programmes e.g. ICT Dept’s #ThinkER.

<h4>Education &amp; Career Guidance</h4>
<p>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) starts even when the students are
in primary school. ECG is incorporated in the CCE (FTGP) lessons and aims
to equip students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make
informed education and career decisions. Through ECG, students are provided
with opportunities to learn more about their interests, abilities, and
passions. They also get to explore various education and career pathways
across different industries.</p>
<p>Students enjoy exploring <a href="https://www.myskillsfuture.gov.sg/content/student/en/primary.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MySkillsFuture</a>,
a one-stop portal with information and tools. Through this, they can investigate
various education and career pathways.</p>
<h4>Sexuality Education (for P5 and P6 students)</h4>
<p>1. Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about enabling students to
understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience
as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those
with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible
decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the
family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual
marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support.
The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and
beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore
on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>2. The <strong>Goals</strong> of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To help students make wise, responsible and informed decisions through
the provision of accurate, current and age-appropriate <u>knowledge</u>&nbsp;on
human sexuality and the consequences of sexual activity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To help students know themselves and build healthy and rewarding relationships
through the acquisition of <u>social and emotional skills</u>&nbsp;of self-awareness,
management of their thoughts, feelings and behaviours, development of empathy
for others, possession of effective communication, problem-solving and
decision-making skills; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To help students develop a moral compass, respect for themselves and for
others as sexual beings, premised on the family as the basic unit of society,
through the inculcation of <u>positive mainstream values and attitudes</u>&nbsp;about
sexuality.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>3. The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the
foundation for strong families);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and
unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved
ones.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>OVERVIEW OF CHIJ OUR LADY OF THE NATIVITY’S SEXUALITY EDUCATION PROGRAMME FOR 2025</h4>
<p>4. Sexuality Education is delivered in a holistic manner through the school
curriculum. The content for Sexuality Education is grouped into five main
themes: Human Development, Interpersonal Relationships, Sexual Health,
Sexual Behaviour, and, Culture, Society and Law. You may click <a href="https://go.gov.sg/moe-sexuality-education-scope" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> for
more information on the scope of Sexuality Education in the school curriculum.</p>
<p>5. The subjects that incorporate topics on sexuality include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Science</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Sexuality Education Lessons</u></strong>
</p>
<p>6. The upper primary years mark the onset of puberty. With better nutrition
and improved health care, children are reaching puberty at a younger age
and have to grapple with physical, emotional and psychological changes
in themselves. The implication is that our children are becoming biologically
ready for sexual activity sooner without necessarily having the corresponding
cognitive or emotional maturity to modulate their behaviours. Furthermore,
our young are also exposed to a wide range of influences that could endanger
health and undermine the integrity of the family. Our students require
guidance so that they can respond with discernment to the sexual messages
in the media and other sources.</p>
<p>7. Sexuality Education (SEd) lessons are taught as part of CCE (FTGP)
at Primary 5 and 6. In SEd, students learn to understand the physiological,
social and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy
and rewarding relationships including those with members of the opposite
sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.</p>
