<h2>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</h2><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/CCE/CCE1w.jpg"></div><p>The CCE Department oversees student learning in the three main areas - Pastoral Care, National Education and Student Leadership Development. At CHIJOLN, we believe in creating authentic learning experiences to help each student develop in character, social-emotional well-being, and citizenship dispositions.</p><h3>Key Programmes</h3><h4>CCE Lessons – CCE Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) and CCE Mother Tongue Languages (MTL)</h4><p>At CHIJ OLN, we believe that students’ learning would be optimized in a caring school environment. This is done through building positive teacher-student relationship (TSR) and student-student relationship (SSR). <br>CCE (FTGP) allows teachers and students to interact and build relationships while learning values, skills and knowledge through discussion of contexts and case studies. In CCE (MTL), students deepen their values and citizenship dispositions through discussion of social issues. They also learn to be responsible to their family and community and understand their roles in shaping the future of our nation. <br>Peer support lessons such as help-seeking and help-giving skills are also taught in CCE (FTGP). This seeks to cultivate peer support mindset and skills in every student.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/CCE/CCE3w.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/CCE/CCE2w.jpg"></div></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Group discussion during a CCE lesson</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Circle Time</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Values-in-Action </h4><p>Values-in-Action (VIA) are learning experiences that support students' development as socially responsible citizens. At CHIJ OLN, the VIA programme encourages students to make a positive difference and emphasises compassion and commitment to serve others, particularly the marginalised or disadvantaged. </p><p>Each level embarks on a project that will make a positive difference in the lives of their family members, classmates, school and community levels. Through the VIA programmes, students have opportunities to demonstrate and apply their knowledge, skills and values and contribute meaningfully to the community. </p><p></p><p></p>
