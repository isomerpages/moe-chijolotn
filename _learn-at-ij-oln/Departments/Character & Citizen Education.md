<h2>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</h2><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/CCE/CCE1w.jpg"></div><p>The CCE Department oversees student learning in the three main areas - Pastoral Care, National Education and Student Leadership Development. At CHIJOLN, we believe in creating authentic learning experiences to help each student develop in character, social-emotional well-being, and citizenship dispositions.</p><h3>Key Programmes</h3><h4>CCE Lessons – CCE Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) and CCE Mother Tongue Languages (MTL)</h4><p>At CHIJ OLN, we believe that students’ learning would be optimized in a caring school environment. This is done through building positive teacher-student relationship (TSR) and student-student relationship (SSR). <br>CCE (FTGP) allows teachers and students to interact and build relationships while learning values, skills and knowledge through discussion of contexts and case studies. In CCE (MTL), students deepen their values and citizenship dispositions through discussion of social issues. They also learn to be responsible to their family and community and understand their roles in shaping the future of our nation. <br>Peer support lessons such as help-seeking and help-giving skills are also taught in CCE (FTGP). This seeks to cultivate peer support mindset and skills in every student.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/CCE/CCE3w.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/CCE/CCE2w.jpg"></div></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Group discussion during a CCE lesson</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Circle Time</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Values-in-Action</h4><p>Values-in-Action (VIA) are learning experiences that support students' development as socially responsible citizens. At CHIJ OLN, the VIA programme encourages students to make a positive difference and emphasises compassion and commitment to serve others, particularly the marginalised or disadvantaged.</p><p>Each level embarks on a project that will make a positive difference in the lives of their family members, classmates, school and community levels. Through the VIA programmes, students have opportunities to demonstrate and apply their knowledge, skills and values and contribute meaningfully to the community.</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/CCE/CCE4w.jpg"></div></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/CCE/CCE5w.jpg"></div></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/CCE/CCE14w.jpg"></div></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Helping out with<br>household chores</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Cleaning common spaces <br>in school</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Organising a food donation<br>drive for the community</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h4>National Education &amp; Social Studies Curriculum</h4><p>National Education aims to develop national cohesion, cultivate the instinct for survival as a nation and instill in our students confidence in our nation’s future. It also cultivates the necessary citizenship dispositions: to have a sense of belonging, hope, reality and a will to act.</p><p></p><p>National Education is pervasively implemented in CHIJOLN through Social Studies lessons, NE Commemorative Days, VIA activities and School Wide Learning Journeys. Here are some examples of our NE Commemorative Days activities in school:</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/CCE/CCE18w.jpg"></div></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/CCE/CCE17w.jpg"></div></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Total Defence Day</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>International Friendship Day</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/CCE/CCE16w.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/CCE/CCE15w.jpg"></div></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Racial Harmony Day Carnival</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>CHIJ OLN celebrates National Day</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h4>School Wide Learning Journeys</h4><p>To extend learning beyond the classroom and to provide all students with opportunities to explore their Singaporean identity, all students will participate in at least two learning journeys a year. Through pre-, during- and post-visit experiences to museums, parks, trails etc, our students make connections between what concepts, values and dispositions they are taught and what they experience. Here are some examples of our School Wide Learning Journeys:<br></p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/CCE/CCE6w.jpg"></div></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/CCE/CCE7w.jpg"></div></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/CCE/CCE8w.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/CCE/CCE9w.jpg"></div></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/CCE/CCE10w.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/CCE/CCE11w.jpg"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><h4><strong>Cyber Wellness</strong></h4><p>Technology impacts students’ development in their learning and thinking. We aim to help our students become responsible digital learners who will be able to protect themselves, as they navigate the cyberspace.</p><p>The main platform for the delivery of cyber wellness lessons is through CCE (FTGP) and Cyber Wellness week. Care Ambassadors are also trained to promote the message of cyber wellness to their peers by giving presentations and supporting the cyber wellness programmes in the school. It is also augmented by work done by other programmes e.g. ICT Dept’s #ThinkER.<br></p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/CCE/CCE13w.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/CCE/CCE12w.jpg"></div></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Cyber Wellness lesson during CCE (FTGP)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Care Ambassadors training on cyber wellness</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Education &amp; Career Guidance</h4><p>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) starts even when the students are in primary school. ECG is incorporated in the CCE (FTGP) lessons and aims to equip students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed education and career decisions. Through ECG, students are provided with opportunities to learn more about their interests, abilities, and passions. They also get to explore various education and career pathways across different industries. </p><p>Students enjoy exploring <a href="https://www.myskillsfuture.gov.sg/content/student/en/primary.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MySkillsFuture</a>, a one-stop portal with information and tools. Through this, they can investigate various education and career pathways. </p><p></p>
