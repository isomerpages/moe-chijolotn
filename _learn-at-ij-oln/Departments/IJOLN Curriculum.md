Learning at CHIJ OLN is focused on nurturing each of our girls to be the Confident &amp; Self-Directed Girl of Tomorrow.  As a result of the CHIJ curriculum, we see her living out the IJ Mission and our GRACIA values as she
* Leads with initiative, serves with love
* Thinks creatively and critically
* Communicates confidently
* Remains steadfast in the face of challenges

Guided by our OLN Teaching &amp; Learning Framework, our curriculum focuses on helping our students.
* Learn through active and deep learning
* Learn through teaching processes that activate their learning, that promote thinking &amp; discussion, that facilitate demonstration of learning and through monitoring and provision of feedback.
* Learn in a positive environment that encourages collaboration, that is supported by technology and is enriched by feedback.

<p><img style="width: 60%;" src="/images/Depts/TeachingLearningFramework.png"><i>Figure: The OLN Teaching and Learning Framework (The Frameworkâ€™)</i></p>

The Framework is built on a foundation of understanding the CHIJ Mission, students &amp; learning, teaching and subject matter &amp; goals.

It references the IJ Mission with its focus both on social justice and service and in the development of character of the students, based on Christian values and principles.

In understanding students &amp; learning and in understanding teaching, our teachers are guided by the Singapore Teaching Practice (STP) and Singapore Curriculum Philosophy. They are also guided by developments within educational psychology and in particular that of positive psychology.

Furthermore, subject syllabi, regular professional networking and professional development opportunities ensure that staff understanding of subject matter and goals is current and sees transference to the IJ OLN classroom.

**EdTech Pedagogical Scaffold with its focus on Active Learning, Deep Learning**<br>
The twin notions of active and deep learning feature centrally in The Framework, and is the aim of all learning experiences at IJ OLN. Through lessons incorporating active and deep learning, IJ OLN provides quality educational experiences to its students.

Active learning processes are incorporated in lesson planning, lesson enactment, assessment and feedback using the EdTech Pedagogical Scaffold with which teachers challenge themselves to think and rethink classroom interactions, and design effective learning experiences (with or without technology integration) that lead to deep learning.
When engaged in deep learning, students think critically and communicate and work with others effectively across all subjects. Students learn to self-direct their own education and to adopt the learning dispositions  and they learn to be lifelong learners.


**Teaching Approaches** across subject disciplines, teachers design experiences that see:
1.  Learning Supported by Technology
2.  (Students) Learning Collaboratively
3.  (Students) Learning within a Positive Environment
4.  Learning enriched by Feedback

These four teaching approaches are implemented on their own and in conjunction with one another.
