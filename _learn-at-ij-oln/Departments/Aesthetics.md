<h2>Aesthetics</h2><p>Arts Education is carried out through the Visual Art and Music Instructional Programmes, the Programme for Active Learning (PAL) and the visual and performing Arts Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs). Through these programmes, every student will:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><strong>Learn </strong>about various art forms and techniques;</p></li><li><p><strong>Express </strong>themselves through different aesthetic platforms;</p></li><li><p><strong>Appreciate </strong>different art forms; and</p></li><li><p><strong>Perform </strong>to the best of their ability.</p></li></ul><h3>Key Programmes</h3><h4>Museum-Based Learning</h4><p>Museum-Based Learning is a core learning experience of the Primary Art curriculum. It aims to develop in students an appreciation for the arts through there being an authentic setting and context. It consists of pre-, during- and post-visit experiences to the local art museums/exhibitions. Through visits, students hone their art discussion skills, make connections between artwork and their own experiences. Students also learn valuable values and museum etiquette through the experiences.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/Aesthetics/Aesthetics1w.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/Aesthetics/Aesthetics2w.jpg"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Our curriculum weaves in digital media into art making and expression. In our art syllabus, upper primary students get to explore the many possibilities of technology such as Adobe Photoshop and Microsoft Powerpoint to create interesting visual imagery, whilst at the same time honing their digital skills and understanding concepts and values associated with cyberwellness.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/Aesthetics/Aesthetics3w.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Singapore Youth Festival (Visual Arts &amp; Performing Arts)</h4><p>The Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) is an annual event organized by Ministry of Education to celebrate the vitality and talents of our youth in the arts.

Students collaborate with one another to ideate and create an artwork as a level and transform it to a meaningful art installation to display around the school.</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/Aesthetics/Aesthetics8w.jpg"></div></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/Aesthetics/Aesthetics9w.jpg"></div></th></tr></tbody></table><h4>Musically Yours</h4><p>‘Musically Yours’ was conceptualised to share their music / dance talents with their schoolmates.
