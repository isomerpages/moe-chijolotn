<h2>Aesthetics</h2><p>Arts Education is carried out through the Visual Art and Music Instructional Programmes, the Programme for Active Learning (PAL) and the visual and performing Arts Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs). Through these programmes, every student will:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><strong>Learn </strong>about various art forms and techniques;</p></li><li><p><strong>Express </strong>themselves through different aesthetic platforms;</p></li><li><p><strong>Appreciate </strong>different art forms; and</p></li><li><p><strong>Perform </strong>to the best of their ability.</p></li></ul><h3>Key Programmes</h3><h4>Museum-Based Learning</h4><p>Museum-Based Learning is a core learning experience of the Primary Art curriculum. It aims to develop in students an appreciation for the arts through there being an authentic setting and context.  It consists of pre-, during- and post-visit experiences to the local art museums/exhibitions. Through visits, students hone their art discussion skills, make connections between artwork and their own experiences. Students also learn valuable values and museum etiquette through the experiences.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/Aesthetics/Aesthetics1w.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/Aesthetics/Aesthetics2w.jpg"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Our curriculum weaves in digital media into art making and expression.
