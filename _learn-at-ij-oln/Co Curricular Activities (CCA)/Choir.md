<p>WHO WE ARE</p><p>Our choir has a total enrolment of more than 60 students in the choir and they vary between 2 vocal ranges, namely Soprano and Alto. Students learn and perform a wide genre of songs through singing and performing creatively through musical expression, and in so doing they learn to appreciate a range of music and different cultures. </p><p>The members of the choir never fail to improve on their singing skills and continue to go through the training process of vocalization, voice play, pitching, rhythm, and musical note-reading. Through this vigorous process, students learn the values of discipline, resilience, teamwork, and responsibility.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCAPics/Choir1w.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCAPics/Choir2w.jpg"></div></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCAPics/Choir3w.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCAPics/Choir4w.jpg"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>
