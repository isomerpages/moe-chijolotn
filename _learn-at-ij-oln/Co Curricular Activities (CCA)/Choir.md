<h4>WHO WE ARE</h4><p>Our choir has a total enrolment of more than 60 students in the choir and they vary between 2 vocal ranges, namely Soprano and Alto. Students learn and perform a wide genre of songs through singing and performing creatively through musical expression, and in so doing they learn to appreciate a range of music and different cultures.</p><p>The members of the choir never fail to improve on their singing skills and continue to go through the training process of vocalization, voice play, pitching, rhythm, and musical note-reading. Through this vigorous process, students learn the values of discipline, resilience, teamwork, and responsibility.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCAPics/Choir1w.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCAPics/Choir2w.jpg"></div></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCAPics/Choir3w.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCAPics/Choir4w.jpg"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><h4>WHAT WE DO</h4><p>During choir practices, we usually do warm-ups before we start. We sing in rounds and parts, do breathing exercises and warm up our voices by doing lip and mouth muscle exercises. Sometimes the CCA leaders would lead the warm-up and assist our instructors.</p><p>In addition, we learn many new songs and work in teams to master the songs. We would also play games and do teamwork activities to strengthen our bond as members of the choir.</p><p>Our Choir members gets the opportunity to perform in external events like the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (SYF AP) bi-annually. This competition provides opportunities for the singers to showcase their extensive repertoire and singing abilities. Members are also given the opportunity to perform at school events as well as at external venues.</p><h4>CCA LEADERS</h4><p>We develop our CCA leaders to be confident learners who lead by serving and caring for others. Our leaders, known as the Chairman and the Assistant Chairman are responsible for leading and organising the choir during our weekly CCA training sessions.</p><p>They lead the choir in doing voice warm ups, take charge of leading the students to different locations for training and prepare the members to be ready for the main choir training.</p><p>Our CCA leaders play an integral part in promoting a sense of belonging and teamwork for the choir members and they strive to work towards serving the choir with love and to be steadfast in their duties.</p><h4>ACHIEVEMENTS</h4><p><strong>Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 2016</strong> - Accomplishment<br><strong>Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 2018</strong> - Accomplishment<br><strong>Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 2022</strong> - No benchmarking</p><h4>CCA SCHEDULE</h4><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Level</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Day</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Time</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Teachers-in-Charge</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Primary 3 to<br>Primary 6</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Tuesdays</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>3.15 pm - 5.15 pm</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mrs Emily Chew (OIC)<br>Mrs Cindy Oh</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>
