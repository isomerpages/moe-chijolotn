<li><strong>Can my child only come for CCA on alternate weeks?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Attendance is compulsory for all CCA sessions. A student&rsquo;s CCA involvement will only be recognized and reflected in her report book if she stays in the same CCA with at least 80% attendance for the entire CCA calendar year. This is to ensure the student benefits from the CCA participation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Can I request for a transfer of CCA if my child loses interest or prefers another CCA?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Students are not allowed to switch CCAs. Only medical cases will be considered and requests must be substantiated with a doctor&rsquo;s letter. Transfer cases are also subjected to the availability of places in the preferred CCA. Transfer of CCAs for medical cases will happen during CCA Fiesta period (Aug-Sept).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is the follow-up required if a child cannot attend the CCA/meeting?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>An explanation in written form from parents, or a doctor&rsquo;s medical certificate must be submitted to the teacher-in-charge whenever a student fails to attend a session. Teachers can be contacted via their official MOE email address (see respective CCA pages for email address) or the Tok-Tok mobile app.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How do I find out the CCA schedule?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You can visit the individual CCA pages or CCA Schedule page to see the current schedule. When the 2022 schedule is ready, parents will be informed via Parents Gateway, the school website and the CCA Pages.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How does my child withdraw from a CCA?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Please ask your child to collect the CCA Withdrawal Form from any of the teachers-in-charge. Do complete and sign the form before asking your child to submit it to teacher-in-charge, CCA.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Who coaches the CCA?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, specialized and qualified coaches are employed to conduct the CCA sessions. They are required to meet stringent criteria as MOE instructors. In some cases, school teachers will assist in the conduct of the CCA as well.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do I have to pay for my child's participation in the CCA?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>No, there is no cost involved. However personal protection equipment (for eg. ankle guards, elbow braces) should be borne by participants themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How is my child's safety ensured during a CCA practice?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>All risks involved in CCA lessons are mitigated by our risk management procedure. A Teacher-in-charge will always be present at CCA meetings/practices. A qualified first aider is always present at the sports CCA.</p>
