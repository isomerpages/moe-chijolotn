<h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The CCA Programme provides students with a platform to discover their interests and talents. Well-organised and implemented, they can fuel in the individual a life-long love for a particular activity, be it a sport or a musical pursuit. This helps the individual to lead a balanced life in adulthood.</li>
<li>Students progressively develop CCA-specific knowledge, skills, values and attitudes through sustained participation in any of the CCA groups.</li>
<li>CCA also offer excellent platforms for students to learn core values, social and emotional competencies and the emerging 21st Century Competencies.</li>
<li>All CCA emphasise social interaction by providing a common space for friendships and social integration amongst students of diverse backgrounds. Through CCA, students develop a sense of identity and belonging to the school.</li>
