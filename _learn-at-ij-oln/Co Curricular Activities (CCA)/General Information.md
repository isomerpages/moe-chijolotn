<p>The Heart of the Framework is a Student-centric, Values-driven CCA programme.
Our CCA programme is designed to cater to the interests and abilities of
our students, guided by our school values-&nbsp;</p>
<p>Graciousness, Responsibility, Appreciation, Compassion, Integrity and
Adaptability (GRACIA)</p>
<p>The Circle represents a well - rounded and holistic development of our
students through&nbsp; the 5 domains - Physical, Aesthetic, Socio-Moral,
Leadership and Cognitive.</p>
<p>Through sustained and active participation in CCAs, our students are able
to acquire and demonstrate 21st Century Competencies which will enable
them to capitalise on the rich opportunities of the new digital age, while
keeping a strong Singapore heartbeat.</p>

<h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The CCA Programme provides students with a platform to discover their
interests and talents. Well-organised and implemented, they can fuel in
the individual a life-long love for a particular activity, be it a sport
or a musical pursuit. This helps the individual to lead a balanced life
in adulthood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students progressively develop CCA-specific knowledge, skills, values
and attitudes through sustained participation in any of the CCA groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CCA also offer excellent platforms for students to learn core values,
social and emotional competencies and the emerging 21st Century Competencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All CCA emphasise social interaction by providing a common space for friendships
and social integration amongst students of diverse backgrounds. Through
CCA, students develop a sense of identity and belonging to the school.</p>
