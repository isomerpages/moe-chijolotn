<h4>WHO WE ARE</h4><p>The CHIJ OLN Netball team is a close-knit family of players who support one another on and off the court. The Netball team aims to reinforce the school’s GRACIA values, cultivating positive lifelong values and 21st century competencies. Through the weekly training program, the netballers are nurtured to be confident, disciplined and responsible girls who exhibit grit and resilience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCAPics/Netball1w.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCAPics/Netball2w.jpg"></div></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCAPics/Netball3w.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCAPics/Netball4w.jpg"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><h4>WHAT WE DO</h4><p>Our intensive training program is designed to provide our netballers with the relevant and necessary skills and knowledge to adequately prepare them for inter-school competitions and life.</p><p>Before training, students reflect on their short-term personal process goals. During training, fitness conditioning, drills, as well as an understanding of game play are taught. At the end of each training session, students go through a debrief session with the coach. GRACIA values are highlighted to the students as they reflect on the day’s training and learning points.</p><p>In order to challenge themselves, the P5 and P6 Netball School Team compete in the National School Games (NSG) Netball Competition. In the Senior Division, the P6 School Team compete in the South Zone Netball Championships and subsequently move on to compete in the National Inter-School Netball Championships. In the Junior Division, the P5 School Team compete in the ‘Pool’ stage before moving on to the ‘Tiered’ stage competition. </p><p>The competition season lasts from January to April for the Senior division and March to July for the Junior division. </p><p>Apart from the annual championship, our P5 and P6 teams take part in friendly matches with other schools. Our Primary 4 School Team participates in netball carnivals at least once a year. </p><h4>CCA LEADERS</h4><p>CCA leaders form an integral part of student leaders in CHIJ OLN. Netball CCA Leaders work alongside the teachers and coach to help enhance the CCA experiences of their CCA members. Playing an important role in upholding the discipline and forging camaraderie amongst members, Netball CCA Leaders work closely with members to achieve CCA-specific goals. They are empowered to lead the teams in warming up, drills as well as the debrief. They are also involved in inter-CCA collaboration to serve the school by e.g. planning for programmes on a school level.</p><p></p>
