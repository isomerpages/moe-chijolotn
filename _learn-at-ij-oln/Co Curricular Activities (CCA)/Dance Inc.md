<p>WHO WE ARE</p><p>Dance is a form of art and a creative expression of the ideas and feelings of an individual. It allows students to express their ideas about the world around them through non-verbal means of communication.</p><p>In CHIJ OLN, Dance Inc develops in students an appreciation for the aesthetics. Through learning different types of dances, namely Chinese Dance, Modern Dance and Malay Dance, students are exposed to different types of music and are encouraged to think creatively through the dance and musical expressions.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>
