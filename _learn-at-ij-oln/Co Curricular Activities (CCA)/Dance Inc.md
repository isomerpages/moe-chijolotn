<p>WHO WE ARE</p><p>Dance is a form of art and a creative expression of the ideas and feelings of an individual. It allows students to express their ideas about the world around them through non-verbal means of communication.</p><p>In CHIJ OLN, Dance Inc develops in students an appreciation for the aesthetics. Through learning different types of dances, namely Chinese Dance, Modern Dance and Malay Dance, students are exposed to different types of music and are encouraged to think creatively through the dance and musical expressions.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCAPics/DanceInc1w.jpg"></div><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>WHAT WE DO</p><p>Students learn dance in a fun and easy way through a comprehensive and structured dance programme.

This broadens the dance experience of the students. In P4, students will be channelled to develop their potential in a particular dance genre.</p><p>Our dancers perform at school and external events like the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (SYF AP) bi-annually. These platforms provide opportunities for the dancers to showcase their skills that they have learnt during CCA sessions. They gain enriching experiences at school performance platforms like our GRACIA!
