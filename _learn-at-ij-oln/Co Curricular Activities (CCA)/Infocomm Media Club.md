Our members learn and become familiar with block-based Scratch 3.0 coding interface, appreciate the creativity and rigour behind game design and development, and learn to think creatively and work collaboratively.</p><p>Our members are given challenging tasks to complete as part of their training. Some of these challenges include designing an animation, developing a game, and choreographing a digital performance.</p><p>Through hands-on experiential learning, we seek to hone computational thinking and problem-solving skills in our members.</p><h4>CCA SCHEDULE</h4><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Level</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Day</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Time</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Teachers-in-Charge</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Primary 3<br>&amp; Primary 4</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Tuesdays</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>3.15 pm - 5.15 pm</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mdm Joy Voo (OIC)<br>Mr Alphonsus Neo</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>
