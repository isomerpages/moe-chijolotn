<p><strong>Brownie Badges!</strong></p>
<p>The most exciting part of a Brownie's journey is earning badges!<br>Each badge entails Brownies completing a series of tasks related to the badge title. The Observer Badge was one that some of our Brownies managed to earn even during the Covid-19 pandemic (while observing safety measures)!</p>

<p><strong>Puan Noor Aisyah (PNA) Award!<br></strong>The PNA Award is a prestigious award to recognise the efforts made by every Brownie/Girl Guide unit in the service and participation of activities in spreading the word about the Guiding Movement. Some of the activities include Inter-unit Games Days, Brownie Revels, Camps and many more. IJ OLN Brownies Pack 1 and Pack 2 has achieved the highest Gold Award for the 5th consecutive year (2020) and Pack 2 has achieved the Gold Award for the 6th consecutive year (2020)! In case you were wondering, the term 'Pack' in Brownies refers to something like a group.<br><em>*The PNA Award was not awarded in 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</em></p>
<p><strong>Chief Commissioners Award!<br></strong>The Chief Commissionerâ€™s Badge Award is the highest award for a Brownie. Awardees must attain at least five proficiency badges before qualifying to be nominated for this award. The journey towards this award is arduous and the Brownies need to be resilient and committed to persevere to the end. The badge involves studying and reflecting upon the Singapore Girl Guiding history, going through a community outreach programme and an oral examination testing their proficiency in promoting Girl Guiding movement and Singapore. Every year, a number of our Brownies achieve this prestigious award.&nbsp;</p>
