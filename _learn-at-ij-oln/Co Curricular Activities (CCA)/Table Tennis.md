<h4>WHO WE ARE</h4><p>The CHIJ OLN Table Tennis CCA comprises players who train hard every week to hone their skills and develop a sense of camaraderie. The goal is to cultivate a passion for the sport among its members and to instil discipline, resilience and sportsmanship in our players.</p><p></p><h4>WHAT WE DO</h4><p>Our CHIJ OLN Table Tennis team is a family of dynamic players who train twice weekly with professional coaches. Skills such as the different styles of servicing, attacking, and defending, as well as footwork are taught during training. The weekly training enables our students to be focused and to think on their feet. This helps them to hone their skills in making quick decisions to counter opponentsâ€™ actions.</p><p>The team continues to strive towards excellence in training as well as in competitions. Students in the competitive group take part in the National School Games South Zone Table Tennis Championships, and the National Primary Schools Table Tennis Championships. This provides the opportunity for them to put the skills they have learnt to the test. The experiences the players gain from the games are invaluable to the team.</p><p>Through weekly rigorous training and participation in the Zonal and National competitions, our goal is to foster a team of committed, physically fit and mentally strong players.</p><p>The training programme helps:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Players develop basic to intermediate Table Tennis skills</p></li><li><p>Encourage players' dedication and enthusiasm towards the game, and to develop</p><p>excellent discipline, teamwork, and sportsmanship</p></li><li><p>Develop their skills and a love for the sport</p></li><li><p>Develop GRACIA values and SEL competencies through training and competitions</p></li></ul><h4>CCA LEADERS</h4><p>Our CCA leaders play an important role in CHIJ OLN.
