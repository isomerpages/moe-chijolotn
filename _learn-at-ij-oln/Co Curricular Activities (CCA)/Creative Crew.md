<h4>WHO WE ARE</h4><p>Our IJ OLN Creative Crew is a vibrant haven for young artists who aspire to create, inspire, and innovate a community for those with a passion in Art. It is a hub of inspiration and collaboration where we celebrate diverse art forms and encourage individual artistic growth.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCAPics/CCrew1w.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCAPics/CCrew2w.jpg"></div></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCAPics/CCrew3w.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCAPics/CCrew4w.jpg"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><h4>WHAT WE DO</h4><p>We provide opportunities for students to explore different art forms. All the different Art projects serve as platforms for our young artists to develop creativity and self-expression in their art-making process. Through participation in the CCA, the students not only master the necessary skills and techniques of artistic expression but also develop aesthetic understanding and appreciation.</p><p>Our young artists also enjoy the Learning Journeys to the museums and art exhibitions. This increases their awareness of Art in Singapore and the world. Such journeys allow them to gain a greater understanding of concepts and ideas in Art, which can transform into refreshing and artistic masterpieces.</p><p>As our young artists work together to achieve shared goals - sometimes with fellow peers from different backgrounds, they also develop resilience, build character, cultivate the will to succeed and learn to appreciate one another.</p><h4>CCA LEADERS</h4><p>Creative Crew Leaders work alongside the teachers and help enhance the CCA experiences of their CCA members. They are empowered to share ideas and lead discussions in their group. They also play an important role in upholding discipline, forging camaraderie amongst members.</p><h4>ACHIEVEMENTS</h4><p><strong><u>Singapore Youth Festival Art Exhibition 2019</u></strong><br>Category A - Certificate of Recognition<br>Category B - Certificate of Recognition<br>Category C - Certificate of Recognition</p><p><strong><u>Singapore Youth Festival Art Exhibition 2021</u></strong><br>Category B - Certificate of Recognition</p><p><strong><u>Singapore Youth Festival Art Exhibition 2023</u></strong><br>Category A - Certificate of Recognition</p><h4>CCA SCHEDULE</h4><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Level</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Day</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Time</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Teachers-in-Charge</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Primary 5 and<br>Primary 6</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Tuesdays</p></td><td rowspan="2" colspan="1"><p>3.15 pm - 5.15 pm</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mrs Sharon Lai (OIC)<br>Ms Feng Jing Wei<br>Ms Wendy Wong</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Primary 3 and<br>Primary 4</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Thursdays</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mrs Sharon Lai (OIC)<br>Ms Wendy Wong<br>Mdm Safikha</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>
