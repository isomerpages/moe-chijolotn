<p>Believing that our girls need to learn in and out of the classroom, the school has planned a number of field trips for our girls.</p>
<p>All girls will participate in a minimum of 2 such trips per year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Primary 1: Singapore Zoological Gardens &amp; Jacob Ballas Garden</li>
<li>Primary 2: SEA Aquarium &amp; Punggol Community Trail</li>
<li>Primary 3: Eco Trail @ Punggol Waterway &amp; P3 Science Trail @ Gardens by the Bay</li>
<li>Primary 4: Kampong Glam &amp; National Gallery</li>
<li>Primary 5: Little India &amp; Chinatown &amp; Kidzania</li>
<li>Primary 6: P6 Maritime Trail &amp; Values @ Movie</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, departments may plan for additional field trips, e.g. the Primary 4 TL class visited Little India to view the Pongal festivities, the Art Club visited the National Gallery and the P6s viewed the Singapore Bicentennial exhibition.&nbsp;<br /><br />All Primary 4, Primary 5 and Primary 6 girls also participate in camps. This is part of the school&rsquo;s learning programme&nbsp;<strong><em>SPARK</em></strong>&nbsp;(<strong>SP</strong>orts for&nbsp;Active and&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>esilient&nbsp;<strong>K</strong>ids).</p>
