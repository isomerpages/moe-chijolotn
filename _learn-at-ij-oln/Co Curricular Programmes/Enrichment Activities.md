<p>The school has a range of short activities that allow a child to explore her interests. These include</p>
<ol>
<li>Talks &amp; activities held before morning assembly, e.g. talks by NLB to promote reading, performances, Science snippets. The purpose of this is to enrich student learning in a way that they find enjoyable and to link their learning to current issues.</li>
<li>Programmes designed for specific purposes, e.g. the Back To School programme that builds a child&rsquo;s socio-emotional competencies as they come back for a brand new school year, and the P6 Post-Exam programme which reinforces the school&rsquo;s character development programme and strengthens their social emotional competencies as they prepare to transit to a secondary school</li>
<li>Activities held during recess, e.g. Science Week</li>
