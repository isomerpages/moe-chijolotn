<p><a name="Q1"></a><br /><strong>1. What is the purpose of the OLN 360 programme? </strong><br />The purpose of the OLN 360 programme is to facilitate the delivery of the OLN Outcomes by broadening the holistic curriculum and learning domains encountered by our students.</p>
<p><a name="Q2"></a><br /><strong>2. How does the OLN 360 programme broaden my child&rsquo;s interests?</strong><br />Through the OLN 360 programme, your daughter will be exposed to topics and activities in 4 different domains, namely, Sports (<strong><em>Ready, Steady, Go!</em></strong>), Life Skills (<strong><em>Pockets of Joy!</em></strong>), New Media Literacies (<strong><em>#Thinker</em></strong>)&nbsp;and Inquiring into Our World (<strong><em>Have a Heart!</em></strong>). Through these modules then, students will be exposed to a range of areas and experiences.</p>
<p><a name="Q3"></a><br /><strong>3. What happened to some of the CCAs?&nbsp;</strong><br />In the design of the OLN 360 programme, certain activities, skills and competencies linked to some of the CCAs are included. For example, the&nbsp;Ready, Steady, Go!&nbsp;module will incorporate a range of games skills while the&nbsp;Have a Heart!&nbsp;and&nbsp;#Thinker&nbsp;modules will incorporate skills previously taught in the Dramatix, Young Scientists Club and Media &amp; Broadcasting Club. As such, these CCAs were disbanded to prevent a duplication of programmes.</p>
<p><a name="Q4"></a><br /><strong>4. Does this mean that my child will not be able to join a CCA now?&nbsp;</strong><br />No. The aims of the CCAs and the OLN 360 programme differ. Your child can still opt to join a CCA after school, subject to availability of places and your child having the necessary aptitude for the CCA.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Q5"></a><br /><strong>5. Why can't the current CCAs be conducted instead during the 90 minutes?</strong><br />The aims of the CCAs and the OLN 360 programme differ. In addition, the school is not equipped to conduct all existing CCAs concurrently due to a lack of space. Moreover, some CCAs prepare their members for competitions and these need more time and depth of training too, e.g. longer practices in the run-up to competitions.</p>
<p><a name="Q6"></a><br /><strong>6. Will the remaining CCAs be able to cater to all students?</strong><br />Not every student may wish to join a CCA and CCA is not compulsory in the primary school.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Q7"></a><br /><strong>7. Will members of the CCAs removed, have to join another CCA?&nbsp;</strong><br />No, they do not have to. CCA is not compulsory at the primary level. However, students will be given an option to join other CCAs they show an aptitude for.</p>
<p><a name="Q8"></a><br /><strong>8. Do children with CCAs need to take part in the OLN 360 programme?&nbsp;</strong><br />Yes. The OLN 360 programme is a school programme and compulsory, and the aims of the CCAs and the OLN 360 programme differ. The OLN 360 programme is not a replacement for CCA but a separate programme designed to enhance the delivery of the OLN Outcomes.</p>
