<h4><strong>WHO ARE WE</strong></h4>
<p>Welcome to our IJ OLN Creative Crew! It is a haven for young artists who aspire to create, inspire and innovate a community for those with&hellip;In short, A PASSION FOR ART!</p>
<p>All the different Art projects serve as platforms for our young artists to develop creativity and self-expression in their art-making process. Through these our young artists develop resilience, build character, cultivate the will to succeed and learn to appreciate, and sometimes work with fellow peers from different backgrounds to achieve shared goals.</p>
<p>Our young artists also enjoy the occasional Learning Journeys to the museums. This will increase their awareness of Art in Singapore and the world. Furthermore, such journeys allow them to gain a greater understanding of concepts and ideas in Art, which can transform into refreshing and artistic masterpieces.</p>

<h4><strong>PROGRAMME HIGHLIGHTS</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Singapore Youth Festival - Art Exhibition (Bi-Annual - Primary)<br /></strong>The Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Art Exhibition is an annual event organized by the Ministry of Education to celebrate the diverse artistic talents of our youths, at Primary to Junior Colleges/Centralized Institutes. This Art and Craft Exhibition aims to provide opportunities for our students to showcase their artistic talents and to promote art appreciation in our schools.<br />CHIJ OLN submits 3 artworks for the SYF Art Exhibition bi-annually. Our student artists work in teams of 6-10 to conceptualise and create artwork.</p>
<p><strong>Museum Learning Journey<br /></strong>Our members go on learning journeys at least twice a year to various museums in Singapore. Such journeys reinforce educational benefits beyond the classroom by adding depth to their understanding of the massive Art world.</p>
<p><strong>ARTSpedition<br /></strong>ARTSpedition is an expedition into the Arts, presented by both the Art and Music departments. The expedition includes a trip to a play, musical or special museum exhibition at least once a year.

<p><strong>Category C</strong></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Lost in Time&rdquo;,</strong> was accomplished by the Primary 5 and 6 student artists. This artwork invite you to take a trip down memory lane and discover our world of retro gadgets, some of which are lost and forgotten in time. It not only reminds us of how technology made it possible for numerous gadgets to exist in a single mobile device but to disconnect so as to reconnect and experience the real world again.<br />Kudos once again to our student artists and their teacher mentors for their hard work!</p>
