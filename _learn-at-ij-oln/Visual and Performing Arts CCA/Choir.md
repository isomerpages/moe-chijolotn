<tr><p>Our choir comprises of students from Primary 3 to Primary 6. We have a total enrolment of more than 60 students in the choir and they range between 2 vocal ranges, namely Soprano and Alto. </br>Students learn and perform a wide genre of songs through singing, appreciating world culture music and performing creatively through their musical expression.</p>
<p>The members of the choir never fail to improve on their singing skills and continue to go through the training process of vocalization, voice play, pitching, rhythm and musical note-reading. Through this vigorous process, students will learn the values of discipline, resilience, teamwork and responsibility.</p></tr>

<h5>SYF Virtual Choir</h5>
<p>Our choir took part in SYF 2022 Choir AP on 12 August. They sang a Chinese Folk song, entitled Ni Wa Wa.</br>
After many months of preparation, all choir members put up a wonderful performance which incorporated voice harmony and simple actions into the song. Through the SYF practices, the girls also learned discipline and concert etiquette under the guidance of our dedicated choir instructors. </p>

<p>As the choir has been meeting online in 2020 till beginning of 2022, our session was conducted via zoom on Tuesdays from 4 pm to 6pm. We dedicated 1 hour each for the Soprano and Alto section. The instructors played games online, encouraged our members to sing individually and also practiced reading scores and singing in pitch as a choir. We missed seeing each other face to face but the online session was fun as well.</p>
<p>This year, we were finally able to gather together in the Music room to sing as one choir. Join us to experience the joy of singing and performing!</p>
