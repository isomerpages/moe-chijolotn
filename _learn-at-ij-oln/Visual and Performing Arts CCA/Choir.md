<tr><p>Our choir comprises of students from Primary 3 to Primary 6. We have a total enrolment of more than 60 students in the choir and they range between 2 vocal ranges, namely Soprano and Alto. </br>Students learn and perform a wide genre of songs through singing, appreciating world culture music and performing creatively through their musical expression.</p>
<p>The members of the choir never fail to improve on their singing skills and continue to go through the training process of vocalization, voice play, pitching, rhythm and musical note-reading. Through this vigorous process, students will learn the values of discipline, resilience, teamwork and responsibility.</p></tr>

<p><strong>SYF Virtual Choir</strong></p>
<p>Our choir took part in SYF Virtual Choir 2020 by recording their voices on their own. A video was compiled and put together by the students and instructors and it was submitted to the SYF organizers. We are very proud that our choir girls are able to participate in Virtual SYF even in these pandemic times.</p>

<p>As the choir has been meeting online since 2020, our session is conducted via zoom on Tuesdays from 4 pm to 6pm. We dedicate 1 hour each for the Soprano and Alto section. The instructors will play games online, get our members to sing individually and also practice reading scores and singing in pitch as a choir. We missed seeing each other face to face but the online session is fun as well.</p>
<p>Next year, we hope we can all gather together in the Music room to sing as one choir. 2022 is also the year when we will prepare for the SYF presentation. Join us to experience the joy of singing and performing.</p>
