<p>We believe that quality teaching and learning takes place in a caring, inclusive and safe learning environment, one which nurtures our students’ sense of self-worth and dignity. As such, our students’ well-being is important to us.</p><p><strong><u>Our ‘GLOW with Positivity’ Approach for Student Well-being</u></strong><br>IJ OLN‘s ‘GLOW with Positivity’ approach is about enhancing student well-being through our curricular and co-curricular areas.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/SWB/SWB1w.png"></div><p></p><p><strong><u>The Self-Directed Learner</u></strong><br>The IJ OLN’s holistic curriculum strives to inculcate creative and critical thinking in our students to be collaborative, curious, responsible, and reflective learners. We believe that teaching of creative and critical thinking enables our girls to manage their own learning and that this would boost their confidence in themselves and their self-esteem. Our approach is summarised as:</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/SWB/SWB2w.jpg"></div><h4><u>Key Programmes</u></h4><h4>Sisterly Love</h4><p>In CHIJ OLN, we believe that every girl is a sister to another girl and as sisters, they care for each other. &nbsp;Each girl has a sister within and outside class. By caring for one another, our girls live out our GRACIA values and are blessings to others.</p><p>Our ‘Sisterly Love’ programme pairs older girls with younger ones and together, they participate in a series of events throughout the year.&nbsp; These platforms allow both girls to know each other better. Both sisters benefit as they build yet another relationship. In turn, the younger sister will grow to be an older sister and the sisterly love cycle begins all over again!</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/SWB/SWB3w.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/SWB/SWB4w.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/SWB/SWB5w.jpg"></div></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="3"><p>&nbsp;Forging bonds with sisters of two levels through interactions and activities.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Back-to-School Programme</h4><p>Taking place at the start of every semester, the Back-to-School Programme helps our girls develop their social emotional competencies as they get accustomed to a new level and class in January or as they transit back to learning after the June holidays.  </p><p>In January, students participate in a variety of activities over the first few days of school to build rapport with their teachers and classmates.  Teachers carry out class bonding activities through games, mass dance, music and art.  In addition, activities to develop self-regulation competencies in both emotional and learning areas are taught so that our girls have the knowledge and skills to take ownership of their learning.  </p><p>Cross level interaction between older and younger girls is also important to foster a sense of school identity.  Apart from the ‘Sisterly Love’ activities, the older girls also participate in the CHIJ OLN Legacy Programme where seniors talk about their school experiences, share tips on managing a new level, and answer questions from inquisitive juniors. </p><p>Overall, the experiences assure our girls that the learning environment is a caring, inclusive and safe one. </p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Depts/SWB/SWBCollage_w.jpg"></div><p></p>
