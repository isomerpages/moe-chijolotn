<h4>Belief</h4><p>At CHIJ OLN, we believe that every IJ girl is a leader who can make a positive difference through acts of service. Guided by the ideas behind Servant leadership, the IJOLN Student Leadership motto “Lead with Initiative, Serve with Love” reminds our student leaders to be proactive in leading positive change and to serve others wholeheartedly.</p><h4>Approach</h4><p>Leadership begins from within. Students should grow to lead themselves first before they can lead others and be a change agent. Students grow as leaders of themselves when they are grounded in their values and develop strong social-emotional competencies. To lead others effectively, students would need to develop leadership competencies such as communication, conflict management and collaboration skills. As leaders who are agents of change, students are further challenged to develop leadership competencies such as creative problem-solving and critical thinking skills, and project-management skills.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SpecialProg/SLD1w.jpg"></div><h4>Programmes</h4><p>We believe that leadership should be nurtured in every student. Student Leadership Development (SLD) at IJ OLN seeks to develop students’ leadership competencies through various programmes such as CCE (FTGP), OLN 360, PAL, and cohort camps. All students will have the opportunity to experience at least one leadership role in the year. Through their leadership role, students have platforms to lead themselves, lead others and lead change in their class or school community. From P3 to P6, students who demonstrate a higher readiness will be given leadership roles and guided via differentiated programmes (Core 1 and Core 2) for their further development.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Student Leadership Development Structure" src="/images/SpecialProg/SLD2w.jpg"></div></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><em>Student Leadership Development Structure</em></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong><u>Core 1 Student Leaders</u></strong><br></p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Prefectorial Board" src="/images/SpecialProg/SLD3w.jpg"></div></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><em>Prefectorial Board</em></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong><u>Core 2 Student Leaders in action</u></strong></p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SpecialProg/SLD4w.jpg"></div></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SpecialProg/SLD6w.jpg"></div></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SpecialProg/SLD7w.jpg"></div></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><em>Care Ambassadors</em></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><em>Faith Ambassadors</em></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><em>Green Ambassadors</em></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SpecialProg/SLD8w.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SpecialProg/SLD5w.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><em>N.E.
