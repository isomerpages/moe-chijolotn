<h4>Oracy for the 21st Century - LEAP @ IJ OLN</h4><p>LEAP is an acronym that stands for Learn, Engage, Articulate and Perform. Via a progressive approach from lower to upper primary, LEAP nurtures students to be able to:</p><ol data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Express, articulate and justify responses, opinions and arguments</p></li><li><p>Use appropriate registers to communicate effectively</p></li><li><p>Participate actively and respectfully</p></li><li><p>Gain and maintain the interest of listeners</p></li><li><p>Speak audibly and fluently in Standard English</p></li><li><p>Discover their voice and use it for expression and advocacy</p></li></ol><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SpecialProg/ALP1w.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SpecialProg/ALP2w.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SpecialProg/ALP3w.jpg"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Guided by a Framework, all oracy development is holistic and takes into account the development of the whole person.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SpecialProg/ALP4w.jpg"></div><p>At the end of 6 years, our graduates will not only be able to find their voice but use it to make a positive difference such as raising awareness or advocating for worthy causes.</p><p>Such growth goes beyond just developing students into confident and effective speakers. It develops in them empathy and to look beyond themselves. As such, oral communication skills are developed alongside the IJ identity that sees every student using her voice for the voiceless.</p><p>Thus, from class to the school stage, from in person advocacy of causes to video media messages by student leaders and ambassadors, multiple platforms are afforded. These opportunities not only provide authentic environments for students to apply effective communication skills but also avenues to grow leadership capacity.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SpecialProg/ALP5w.jpg"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SpecialProg/ALP6w.jpg"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Indeed, applied learning at CHIJ OLN is one that extends beyond oracy skills. It inspires curiosity, courage and challenges our students to lead in making a positive difference.</p><p></p>
