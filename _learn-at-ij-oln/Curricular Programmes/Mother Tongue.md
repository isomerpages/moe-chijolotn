#### Mother Tongue Language Department
![](/images/Our%20Curriculum/MTL/lj_girl_MTL_learning.jpg)
We aim to develop our students into confident and competent speakers and users of their Mother Tongue Languages - Chinese Language, Malay Language and Tamil Language – and as users with a love and an appreciation of their own culture and traditional values. The teachers work together to create a fun and interesting learning environment for students to foster their interest and passion for the language and culture.

##### Key Programmes: 
##### School Based Reading Programme
Our school-based reading programme seeks to cultivate joy and interest in reading story books in the Mother Tongue Languages. This would enhance students’ appreciation for the language.

##### Conversational Chinese &amp; Malay Programme
The Conversational Chinese and Malay (CCM) programme aims to strengthen Singapore’s multi-racial compact and is available to students who are unfamiliar with the Chinese Language or Malay Language. Through modular and topic-based online lesson units over 5 days, students learn to converse in the language.

##### Enhancing An Understanding Of Cultures
The learning of culture and of languages are linked. As we learn a language, we learn more about their culture. Learning a culture too is aided when, you can communicate in the language. To that end, IJOLN annually plans programmes to help our students better understand cultures – that linked with the language they are studying as their Mother Tongues as well as others.

**The Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Fortnight**<br>
This takes place in Term 3 and provides opportunities for all students to actively understand and appreciate the different cultures linked to the various Mother Tongue languages they and their friends learn in school. Through a wide range of fun and interactive activities, students get opportunities to use their MTL and experience the cultures.

**Attending performances** <br>
Where possible, students are provided with opportunities to watch performances. Through enjoying the performances put up by local and foreign arts groups, students enjoy language and culture in a different environment. 
In 2023, P2 Chinese Language learners had the opportunity to watch a live performance entitled “Cinderella” at the National Library Drama Centre.
