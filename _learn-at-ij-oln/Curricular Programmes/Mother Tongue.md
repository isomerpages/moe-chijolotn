#### Mother Tongue Language Department
![](/images/Our%20Curriculum/MTL/lj_girl_MTL_learning.jpg)
We aim to develop our students into confident and competent speakers and users of their Mother Tongue Languages - Chinese Language, Malay Language and Tamil Language – and as users with a love and an appreciation of their own culture and traditional values. The teachers work together to create a fun and interesting learning environment for students to foster their interest and passion for the language and culture.

#### Key Programmes:  
##### School Based Reading Programme
Our school-based reading programme seeks to cultivate joy and interest in reading story books in the Mother Tongue Languages. This would enhance students’ appreciation for the language.
