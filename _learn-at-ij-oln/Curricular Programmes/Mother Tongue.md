#### Mother Tongue Language Department
![](/images/Our%20Curriculum/MTL/lj_girl_MTL_learning.jpg)
We aim to develop our students into confident and competent speakers and users of their Mother Tongue Languages - Chinese Language, Malay Language and Tamil Language – and as users with a love and an appreciation of their own culture and traditional values. The teachers work together to create a fun and interesting learning environment for students to foster their interest and passion for the language and culture.

##### Key Programmes: 
##### School Based Reading Programme
Our school-based reading programme seeks to cultivate joy and interest in reading story books in the Mother Tongue Languages. This would enhance students’ appreciation for the language.

##### Conversational Chinese &amp; Malay Programme
The Conversational Chinese and Malay (CCM) programme aims to strengthen Singapore’s multi-racial compact and is available to students who are unfamiliar with the Chinese Language or Malay Language. Through modular and topic-based online lesson units over 5 days, students learn to converse in the language.

##### Enhancing An Understanding Of Cultures
The learning of culture and of languages are linked. As we learn a language, we learn more about their culture. Learning a culture too is aided when, you can communicate in the language. To that end, IJOLN annually plans programmes to help our students better understand cultures – that linked with the language they are studying as their Mother Tongues as well as others.
