<h4><strong>Vision Mission</strong></h4>
<p>IJ OLN’s Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) department aims to inculcate values and build competencies in our students so that they become citizens of good character who will step forward to make a positive difference. The CCE department works together with the other departments to create authentic learning experiences to develop Girls of Today for Tomorrow. </p>

<li><strong>Pastoral Care</strong>looks into the emotional well-being and development of the students through fostering a strong teacher-student, student-student relationship through platforms like Back to School Programme, CCE (Form Teacher’s Guidance Programme), GLOW Morning Activities.
