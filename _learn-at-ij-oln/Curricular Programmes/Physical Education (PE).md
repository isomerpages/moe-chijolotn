<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<img style="width: 50%;" src="/images/pe1.png" />
<p style="text-align: center;">A vibrant and inclusive programme that provides character building experiences through physical education</p>
<h4><strong>Goals</strong></h4>
<h4>Goals of Physical Education</h4>
<p>Goal 1: Acquire a range of movement skills to participate in a variety of physical activities.</p>
<p>Goal 2: Understand and apply movement concepts, principles and strategies in a range of physical activities.</p>
<p>Goal 3: Demonstrate safe practices during physical and daily activities with respect to themselves, others and the environment.</p>
<p>Goal 4: Display positive personal and social behaviour across different experiences.</p>
<p>Goal 5: Acquire and maintain health-enhancing fitness through regular participation in physical activities.</p>
<p>Goal 6: Enjoy and value the benefits of living a physically active and healthy life.</p>
<p>The lower primary level focuses on mastery of fundamental motor skills such as locomotor, non- locomotor and manipulative skills with application of movement concepts to develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in students&rsquo; performance. Once the foundation is laid, the upper primary level extends on the mastery of discrete skills to focus on more complex combinations and sequences of movements, and skills application in more recognisable forms of activity and games.</p>
<p>The syllabus provides diversity and breadth for schools to plan and implement a well-balanced physical education programme. The seven learning areas are:<br />Athletics (from Primary 3)</p>
<ul>
<li>Dance</li>
<li>Games and Sports</li>
<li>Gymnastics</li>
<li>Swimming (by the end of Primary 6)</li>
<li>Outdoor Education</li>
<li>Physical Health and Fitness</li>
</ul>

<p>To foster better teamwork, camaraderie, cooperation and identity, every student from P3-P6 is assigned a House based on the class that they are allocated. The Form and Co-Form Teachers of the classes will function as their House Masters / Mistresses. Four students in each class will be appointed as PE Monitors so as to lead their peers during house activities. This structure provides ample opportunities for the students to develop their leadership potential, and at the same time exposing them to the trials and tribulations of being a leader. Students undergo training for the respective House events during PE lessons and at the end of the year; the best performing House will be awarded the Overall House Champion.</p>
