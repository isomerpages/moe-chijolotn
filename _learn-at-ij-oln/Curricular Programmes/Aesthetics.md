<p>The OLN Aesthetics Framework structured the cognitive, psychomotor and affective development of our students under four behavioural domains : Learning, Expressing, Appreciating and Performing in order to develop creative, cultured citizens. This is very much in line with the school vision to develop girls of today for tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Learning, teachers provide opportunities for students to explore art, music and dance elements and theory through various engaging activities.</p>
<p>In Expressing, teachers engage students through experiencing different art media and music genres and apply knowledge and skills in the creation of art, music and dance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Appreciating, student learning is enriched through the exposure to different artists and composers.</p>
<p>In Performing, students are given opportunities to excel as they present the various art forms to an audience.</p>
