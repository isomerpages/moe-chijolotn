##### STELLAR (Strategies for English Language Learning And Reading) 

STELLAR is an interactive literacy programme that fosters confidence in learning English using children's literature. Through STELLAR, our students develop a love for learning and acquire a strong foundation in English. Additionally, meaning-making is strengthened with renewed emphasis on viewing and representing. This is further enhanced by engagement with rich multimodal perspectives. At CHIJ OLN, experiential and applied learning opportunities in the STELLAR classroom are also infused so as to enliven and inject joy in language learning.
