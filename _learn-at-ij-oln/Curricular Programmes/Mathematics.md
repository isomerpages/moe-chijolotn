<h4>Aims Of Mathematics Education In IJ OLN</h4>
<ul>
<li>acquire the necessary mathematical concepts and skills for everyday life</li>
<li>develop the necessary process skills for acquisition and application of mathematical concepts and skills</li>
<li>develop mathematical thinking &amp; problem solving skills and apply these skills to formulate and solve problems</li>
<li>use mathematical language to express mathematical ideas precisely, concisely and logically</li>
<li>develop positive attitude towards mathematics</li>
<li>use a variety of mathematical tools in the learning &amp; application of mathematics</li>
</ul>
<h4>Mathematics Framework</h4>
<img style="width: 60%;" src="/images/math1.png" />
<p>The department&rsquo;s framework is adapted from MOE&rsquo;s Mathematics Framework.&nbsp; It shows the underlying principles of an effective mathematics programme.&nbsp; It sets the direction for teaching, learning and assessment of mathematics in IJ OLN.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>Teaching Of Heuristics and Problem Solving</strong></h4>
<p>A school-wide approach is adopted in the teaching of Heuristic and problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>Teaching of Heuristic and problem-solving skills is done in a spiral manner where basic skills are taught in the Lower Primary (P1 to P3). As learning progresses, at the Upper Primary (P4 to P6), more details are introduced, while at the same time they are related to the basics which are</p>
<p><strong>Examples of Heuristic skills<br /></strong>Patterns<br />Guess &amp; Check<br />Listing<br />Working Backwards<br />Before &amp; After Concepts</p>
<h4>Mathematics In Modules Programme (M 2 P)</h4>
<p>The Mathematics in Modules Programme (M&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;P) is a 2-year programme that is specially designed to meet the learning needs of our P5 and P6 students. In M&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;P, similar topics covered in both P5 and P6 restructured and taught as modules. The programme aims to make connections in students&rsquo; learning experiences when acquiring mathematical skills and concepts and thus, building their enduring understandings.</p>

<h4>Play &amp; Learn Programme</h4>
<p>The Department believes in helping students build strong foundation in Primary Maths through a structured P&amp;L teaching sequence and supporting manipulative and materials based on the concrete-pictorial-abstract (CPA) approach.</p>
<img style="width: 50%;" src="/images/math2.jpg" />
<p>With the CPA approach, students are first allowed to play with manipulatives which help them get a better feel of what they are learning. Pictorial representations are then used to illustrate the problem/concept in another manner for students to read and interpret. When students demonstrate readiness, they will be introduced the abstract representation such as numbers or letters.</p>
<h4>Mathematics Olympiad Training</h4>
<p>Mathematics Olympiad Training sessions are organised for P2 to P6 students with very good mastery of the subject. Those with potential will also be identified to represent the school in external competitions like the Hwa Chong Institution &amp; NUS High Mathematics Olympiad Competitions.</p>
