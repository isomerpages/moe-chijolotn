Learning at CHIJ OLN is focused on nurturing each of our girls to be the Confident & Self-Directed Girl of Tomorrow.  As a result of the CHIJ curriculum, we see her living out the IJ Mission and our GRACIA values as she
* Leads with initiative, serves with love
* Thinks creatively and critically
* Communicates confidently
* Remains steadfast in the face of challenges

Guided by our OLN Teaching & Learning Framework, our curriculum focuses on helping our students.
* Learn through active and deep learning
* Learn through teaching processes that activate their learning, that promote thinking & discussion, that facilitate demonstration of learning and through monitoring and provision of feedback.
* Learn in a positive environment that encourages collaboration, that is supported by technology and is enriched by feedback.
