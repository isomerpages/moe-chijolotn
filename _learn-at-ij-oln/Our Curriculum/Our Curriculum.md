<p>Learning at OLN is focused on guiding our girls to be the Girl of Tomorrow as described in our outcomes:<br />A girl who &hellip;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Acts according to the IJ Mission and our GRACIA values.</li>
<li>Leads with initiative, serves with love.</li>
<li>Communicates confidently</li>
<li>Thinks creatively, reflects thoughtfully.</li>
<li>Remains steadfast in the face of challenges&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>To attain this, the school has designed a holistic curriculum that takes place within the school day as well as after it. The programme is guided by our OLN Teaching &amp; Learning Framework (rev 2017) which focuses on helping our children</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn through active and deep learning</li>
<li>Learn through teaching processes that activate their learning, promote thinking &amp; discussion, facilitate demonstration of learning and through monitoring and provision of feedback while the girls are learning.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Learn in a positive environment that encourages collaboration, that is supported by technology and is enriched by feedback.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of the school&rsquo;s 8 departments builds their learning programmes based on this framework. Information on the learning of subjects can be found&nbsp;<a href="/learn-at-ij-oln/our-curriculum/tnl-framework" target="">here</a>.</p>
<p>The holistic programme goes beyond class learning and is supported by a vibrant co-curricular programme. Information on the co-curricular programme can be found&nbsp;<a href="/learn-at-ij-oln/co-curricular-programmes" target="">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
