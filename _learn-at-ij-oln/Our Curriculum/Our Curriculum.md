Learning at CHIJ OLN is focused on nurturing each of our girls to be the Confident &amp; Self-Directed Girl of Tomorrow.  As a result of the CHIJ curriculum, we see her living out the IJ Mission and our GRACIA values as she
* Leads with initiative, serves with love
* Thinks creatively and critically
* Communicates confidently
* Remains steadfast in the face of challenges

Guided by our OLN Teaching &amp; Learning Framework, our curriculum focuses on helping our students.
* Learn through active and deep learning
* Learn through teaching processes that activate their learning, that promote thinking &amp; discussion, that facilitate demonstration of learning and through monitoring and provision of feedback.
* Learn in a positive environment that encourages collaboration, that is supported by technology and is enriched by feedback.

The Framework is built on a foundation of understanding the CHIJ Mission, students &amp; learning, teaching and subject matter &amp; goals.

It references the IJ Mission with its focus both on social justice and service and in the development of character of the students, based on Christian values and principles.

In understanding students &amp; learning and in understanding teaching, our teachers are guided by the Singapore Teaching Practice (STP) and Singapore Curriculum Philosophy. They are also guided by developments within educational psychology and in particular that of positive psychology.

Furthermore, subject syllabi, regular professional networking and professional development opportunities ensure that staff understanding of subject matter and goals is current and sees transference to the IJ OLN classroom.
