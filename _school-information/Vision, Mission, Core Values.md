<h4><strong>School Mission</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>Mission of CHIJ SCHOOLS</strong></h4>
<p>A CHIJ School is a Christ-centered school community where all work together for the promotion of truth, justice, freedom and love, with special reference to the needs of persons who are disadvantaged in any way.</p>
<p><strong>Christ-centered Community<br></strong>The CHIJ community rests on the central Christian belief of the worth and dignity of each person. It therefore demands a continuing effort by all in the development of an inclusive "community" anchored on the example of Christ as revealed in the Gospels. The driving force of this community is therefore inspirational. Children who join a CHIJ School are welcomed into a faith-based community where growth and formation flow from the Christian values that underpin the efforts of the school.</p>
<p><strong>Working Together<br></strong>It is a collaborative, integrated relationship where all persons who form the school community give generously of themselves and receive likewise. It provides the element which encourages a harmonious atmosphere and provides that extra support in times of need.</p>
<p><strong>Promotion of Truth<br></strong>It is an honest and genuine quest in the pursuit of knowledge; it is the art of guiding students to become critical thinkers by rejecting the trivial in order to focus on things that are worthwhile. It is the cultivation of an attitude that appreciates the value of learning, conveys the excitement that learning brings and fosters the desire for its pursuit. It is the application of resources in the stimulation of intellectual curiosity.</p>
<p><strong>Promotion of Justice<br></strong>It is to be witness to the living out of justice in all school relationships and transactions to ensure that the conditions for learning are conducive to the development of every child fully according to her ability. It is to foster in the students a sense of fairness, a compassion for the weak and the less endowed, so that students too participate in each other's growth and well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Promotion of Freedom<br></strong>It is the 'freeing of oneself' from self-interest, from selfishness, from captive addiction to the shallow and inconsequential - so as to be free to make discerning choices and to reach out in sincerity and honesty to others. It is the cultivation of a personal disposition which will 'free oneself' to be of genuine service in the development and growth of others, particularly the less and more vulnerable.</p>
<p><strong>Love<br></strong>It is the all-embracing virtue which binds and integrates everything - the ultimate glue! It is the underlying inspiration that prompts students and the school community to rise above themselves and to reach out in compassion to the wider community.<br>St Paul - "Love is patient. Love is kind. Love is not jealous, it does not put on airs. Love is never rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not prone to anger, neither does it brood over injuries. Love does not rejoice in what is wrong, but rejoices with the truth. There is no limit to Love's forbearance, to its trust, its hope, its power to endure. Love never fails".<br>{St Paul's Letter to the Corinthians 13:4-8}</p>
<p><strong>With special reference to the needs of persons who are disadvantaged in anyway<br></strong>This requires a sensitive alertness to identify students who are not coping with school life and to offer or seek out the assistance that will help each better handle the situations which burden them. The sensitive helping disposition is not meant to be restricted to the school situation but to be extended to the wider community, whenever one encounters the weak or the burdened.</p>
