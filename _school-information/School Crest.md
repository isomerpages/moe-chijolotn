<p>This badge or crest was designed by Mother Saint Aloysia and the CHIJ senior students in 1894 in France incorporating into its concept and design, values and aspirations which they wished to be lived out in each CHIJ School. Their design is still proudly worn by thousands of CHIJ&nbsp;students&nbsp;in the 21st century. This badge is a symbol of the international unity binding together&nbsp;students&nbsp;from every continent, especially CHIJ&nbsp;students&nbsp;from Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Japan.</p>
