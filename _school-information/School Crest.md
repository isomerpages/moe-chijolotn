<p>This badge or crest was designed by Mother Saint Aloysia and the CHIJ
senior students in 1894 in France incorporating into its concept and design,
values and aspirations which they wished to be lived out in each CHIJ School.
Their design is still proudly worn by thousands of CHIJ&nbsp;students&nbsp;in
the 21st century. This badge is a symbol of the international unity binding
together&nbsp;students&nbsp;from every continent, especially CHIJ&nbsp;students&nbsp;from
Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Japan.</p>

in gold. On the right side of the shield is the Book of Gospels with a
silver rosary. On the left is a golden distaff and spindle. The shield,
surmounted by a gold cross, is encircled by a garland of marguerites. Emblazoned
on the crest is the motto of all CHIJ schools:</p>
