<h4>School Rules</h4>
<p>In our CHIJ Schools, we uphold the basic principle of respecting the dignity
of each person we interact with. Everyone in our school community has the
responsibility for, and a role to play in building a safe learning environment
where we treat each other with respect and understanding. As such, our
school will not tolerate any unlawful or disruptive behaviour, including
any form of bullying, cyber-bullying, intimidation or retaliation.</p>
<p>We expect all students to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Be courteous, considerate and honest at all times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treat others and all property with consideration and respect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete and hand in any homework given punctually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move quietly and in an orderly manner from one place to another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Queue when awaiting their turn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep the school clean at all times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be loyal to the school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Live up to the school motto, 'Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty'.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Grooming and Attire</h4>
<p>An example on how an IJ OLN girl should be attired is found on page 28-29.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students are to wear the prescribed school uniform and modification to
the uniform is not allowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are to wear only white socks and shoes. The length of the school
socks should be appropriate (approximately 2 cm to 5 cm above the ball
of the ankle).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students must have their name tags ironed or sewn onto their school uniform
and PE attire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students must be neat and properly attired in their school uniform at
all times, inside and outside school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are allowed to wear jackets or cardigans only when the weather
is cold. They are not to be hung from the waist when not worn and the hood
section of a hoodies is not allowed to be worn over the head within the
school premises.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students should have trimmed nails without nail polish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students should not wear make-up in school. This includes tinted lip balm
and tinted moisturiser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students should only have <u>one</u> pair of piercing on the lower lobe
of each ear.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>School PE T-shirt</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students are allowed to wear the school’s PE T-shirt and shorts the whole
day on days when they have PE or PAL lessons. They must put on their pinafore
over their PE attire during their arrival at school and during dismissal
from school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If students attend SwimSafer lessons, they are to change into the school’s
PE T-shirt (under their pinafore) after the session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who are going for camps should report to school in their PE/Camp
T-shirt and track pants. Swimming attire can be worn underneath the PE/Camp
T-shirt if the first programme for the day involves a water-based activity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Hair/ Hair Accessories</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Hair that touches the collar should be tied up into a ponytail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fringe should not touch the eyebrows. Long fringes should be pinned up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only plain black hair accessories are allowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The black hair accessories should be simple. Fanciful designs like big
bows and charms on hair accessories are not allowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are not allowed to colour their hair.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Ear Studs</h4>
<p>Students are allowed to wear small simple ear studs as specified below.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>"small”: The ear studs should not be larger than 0.5 cm in diameter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“simple”: The ear stud should be of a plain design, round and of a single
colour, i.e. gold, silver, white or black. It can be made of plastic or
metal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“ear studs”: Students should not wear ear loops/hoops as this is a safety
concern. Hoops can catch onto fingers or other objects while playing or
during activities, and injuries can and have occurred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These are some images of ear studs currently used by our girls that are
in line with the school rules.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Ear_studs.jpg">
</div>
<p><strong>Should a student wear ear studs not in line with the guidelines, parents will be informed and requested to partner the school to help the child comply with the rule. Should the student still not change her ear studs, she will be given a pair of transparent ear sticks to use instead of her ear studs. Parents will then be notified of this. Please note that the school will not be responsible for any loss of the ear studs</strong>.</p>

<h4>Use of electronic Devices</h4>
<p>Students should not bring electronic devices to school, e.g. tablets,
laptops, digital cameras, handheld electronic games, etc. The school provides
students with the use of school-owned ICT devices for technology-enabled
lessons.</p>
<h4>Smartphone and Smart Watch Policy</h4>
<p>The school provides students with the use of school-owned ICT devices
for technology-enabled lessons. In addition, students should not be distracted
by notifications from smartphones or smartwatches during school hours.
Should a student need to contact a family member or caregiver in the case
of illness or to make transport arrangements, she is to approach the administrative
staff in our General Office for assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Students are discouraged from bringing personal smartphones and/or smartwatches to schools.</strong>
</p>
<p>In the event that you require your child to bring her smartphone/smartwatch
to school, please submit your request via the request link in Parents Gateway
sent in January 2026.</p>
<p>Please take note of the following conditions that would then apply should
your child bring a smartphone/smartwatch to school:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Smartphones/smartwatches are to be switched off once students step into
the school premises.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are not allowed to use personal digital devices such as smartphones
and smartwatches during school hours. This includes recess, CCA and after-school
programmes e.g. support/enrichment lessons. Students are not to use their
devices to make/receive calls or texts, take pictures or make any form
of recording. The only exception is the POSB Smart Buddy watch which can
be use during recess and at lunch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Devices must be switched off when brought to school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students bear responsibility for the safekeeping of their devices, e.g.
in their school bags. This includes smartwatches as they should not be
worn on the wrist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students should use their smartphone/smartwatch after school hours only
to call/text their parents/guardians and not for any other purpose e.g.
gaming, using social media, etc. They are to use their smartphone/smartwatch
after school hours at the Security Guard Post at Side 2 within the school
premises.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should a student need to contact a family member or caregiver in the case
of illness or to make transport arrangements, she is to approach the administrative
staff in our General Office for assistance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Should the above conditions not be adhered to, the smartphone/smartwatch will be confiscated and the permission to bring a smartphone/smartwatch to school may be revoked.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>The school will not be responsible for any loss or damage to the smartphone/smartwatch brought to school.</strong>
</p>
<h4>Assembly and Flag-raising Ceremony</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Be on time for Assembly at 7.30 a.m. from Monday to Friday. Students who
are not in the hall or with their class for Assembly at 7.30 a.m. will
be considered late.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All students are to be still and respectful during morning prayers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who are Singapore citizens must sing the National Anthem and
take the Pledge. Students will take the Pledge with their right fist placed
over their heart.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Attendance</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students must be punctual for school and lessons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All students are required to attend school daily during the school terms.
Under the Singapore Compulsory Education Act, " a child of compulsory school
age shall attend regularly as a student at a national primary school" .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The school curriculum designed to be implemented over 40 weeks, prepares
students academically for the subsequent levels. Much of what is taught
is progressive and builds on concepts/content previously taught. As such,
students should not be absent from school during term time, even if the
examinations are over. Parents/Guardians are requested to support the school
in inculcating the values of commitment and responsibility in our students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students will be considered <strong>absent without valid reason </strong>should
they go for holidays overseas or staycations during school term as curriculum
time is sacrosanct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attendance is compulsory on all school days, events and activities. Students
who are absent must inform the school of their absence and present medical
certificates or letters from parents/guardians when they return to school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The school will accept <strong>a maximum of 10 letters</strong> from parents/guardians <strong>per year</strong> for
their child's/ward's absence from school. For subsequent absences, <strong>Absent Without Valid Reason will be keyed into the Attendance System.</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parents/Guardians must sign the "Permission to Leave School" form in the
General Office to take their child/ward home before the official dismissal
time.</p>
</li>

<p><strong><em>Note: Students with a discipline record and those with a conduct grade of Fair or Poor will not be eligible for any award given by the school and/or MOE.</em></strong>
