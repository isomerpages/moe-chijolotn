<h4>Recess</h4>
<p>To encourage independence in our girls, parents/guardians will not be
allowed to come into the school at recess time.
<br>Pocket money should be kept to a minimum. $2 - $4 would be adequate to
buy food during recess each day. Students are encouraged to drink plain
water (from their water bottles or the water coolers in the school) instead
of sweetened drinks.
<br>The school canteen stalls have POSB Smart Buddy terminals for students
who have the POSB Smart Buddy watch or bus card with value. For more information
on how to apply for a POSB Smart Buddy watch, please refer to <a href="https://posb.com.sg/chijoln" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://posb.com.sg/chijoln</a>.
Do note that it is not compulsory to use the POSB Smart Buddy watch in
school.</p>
<h4>Snack Time</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students are given a 10-minute snack break in class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please pack nutritious dried food items for your child/ward. Cooked food
and food items that need to be chilled (e.g. sushi) are not allowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Healthier Choice Symbol (HCS) endorsed by the Health Promotion Board
can be used to guide the purchase of healthy snacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are not allowed to buy snacks from the canteen during lessons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are not encouraged to share snacks with their friends to avoid
potential food allergy reactions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Dismissal</h4>
<p>Parents/Guardians are requested to wait outside Side Gate 1 or 2 to pick
up their child/ward. Please note that the HDB carpark is most crowded 10
minutes before/after dismissal.</p>
<h4>Safety and Security</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students are to enter/exit the school premises through Side Gate 1 or
2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the safety of the students, please refrain from waiting in the car
near the bus stop during dismissal. A gentle reminder that parking within
9 metres of a bus stop is a traffic offence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you need to enter the school to see your child's/ward's teacher, please
make an appointment with the teacher in advance. You will also need to
sign in at the Security Guard Post.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Opening Hours of School Gates</h4>

<p><u>Water</u>
<br>Students are encouraged to drink water instead of sweetened drinks. Please
encourage your child/ward to bring a water bottle to school every day.
There are water coolers located around the school for refilling purposes.</p>
<p><u>Eye Care</u>
<br>You can encourage your child/ward to practise good eye care habits when

<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>She sits upright in a comfortable chair at a table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is enough light in the room.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She holds the book about 30 cm away from her eyes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She takes vision breaks of 3 to 5 minutes to look at distant objects after
reading for 30 to 40 minutes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Unwell Student</u>
<br>A student who is unwell should not come to school. She should rest at
home until she is medically fit to return to school.</p>
<h4>Supervising you Child/Ward</h4>
<p>You are encouraged to supervise your child's/ward's work regularly so
as to keep yourself informed of her progress. Her exercise books and files
are returned regularly for your signature. Showing concern for your child's/ward's
progress encourages her to do better.</p>
