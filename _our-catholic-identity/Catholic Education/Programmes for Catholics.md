<p>There are programmes designed specifically to help our Catholic students form their faith. Nevertheless, non-Catholics are welcomed to join in. Parents can inform their child&rsquo;s form teacher if they would like their child to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Our TLC Lessons (Together Learning about Christ)</strong></h4>
<img style="width: 50%;" src="/images/poc1.jpg" />
<p>On scheduled Mondays during Values Education Lessons, Catholic students come together to learn about the teachings of Jesus Christ. Currently, TLC lessons are conducted online. Do note that TLC does not replace Catechism as Catechism conducted by churches prepares children for the Sacraments of Communion, Reconciliation and Confirmation whereas TLC does not.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Masses</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Term Masses</strong><br />Once a term, Catholic students and teachers come together and participate in a mass at the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary. However, due to Safe Management Measures, this is currently suspended.</p>
<p><strong>Holy Days of Obligation</strong><br />On the Holy Days of Obligation (Solemnity of the Ascension of the Lord, Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Solemnity of All Saints&rsquo; Day), we conduct mass for Catholic students in the mornings at 7.00a.m before school starts. Parents are also invited to join us in the mass. Although currently also suspended, we look forward to the time when we can celebrate the Holy Days of Obligation together again!</p>
<h4><strong>Celebrating the Marian Months of May and October</strong></h4>

<p>In 2021, in addition to the morning recitation of the Rosary, this year our P5 Catholic students also came together for a Rosary-making activity using recycled craft materials such as colourful beads and straw cleaners to make simple rosaries. They also set up a walking rosary in the school&rsquo;s prayer room which was subsequently visited by students from other levels during recess. At the end of the decade, students would pick up a flower petal and offer it up to Mother Mary. The semester ended with a Zoom Rosary Prayer Session for the Catholic girls and family members.</p>
