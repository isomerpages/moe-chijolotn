Nurturing the value of the Catholic identity and ethos in our everyday school life provides guidance to our Catholic students.&nbsp; These practices serve as the lifelong foundation, giving them meaning and purpose as they live a God-centred life.

Prayer is an integral part of our daily routine in school. Our Faith Ambassadors lead in prayer daily, at morning assembly, after recess as we sing a hymn of thanksgiving and later again at dismissal.

We start off our week each Monday with a reflection on a verse taken from the previous Sunday’s readings. A teacher not only explains the verse but also poses reflection questions for all to think about and act on.&nbsp;
