<p>Our faith-related programmes are for students of all religions. If they are not Christian, they are invited to sit in respect and/or pray in their hearts, the way their parents taught them at home.</p>

<p>Prayer is an integral part of our daily routine in school at three points in the day &ndash; before the flag raising ceremony, after recess and before dismissal. Our Catholic students lead in singing our CHIJ OLN Thanksgiving Prayer after recess and in reciting the Guardian Angel Prayer before dismissal.</p>
