<p>Our faith-related programmes are for students of all religions. If they are not Christian, they are invited to sit in respect and/or pray in their hearts, the way their parents taught them at home.</p>
<h4><strong>Daily Prayer</strong></h4>

<p>Prayer is an integral part of our daily routine in school at three points in the day &ndash; before the flag raising ceremony, after recess and before dismissal. Our Catholic students lead in singing our CHIJ OLN Thanksgiving Prayer after recess and in reciting the Guardian Angel Prayer before dismissal.</p>

<p>We start our week off each Monday with a reflection on a verse taken from the previous Sunday&rsquo;s readings. A teacher not only explains the verse but also poses meaningful reflection questions for all to think and act on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our Chinese New Year celebration is always an exciting event. Not only do we listen to CNY songs and enjoy CNY&ndash;related craft, we also invite Father Kenson from the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary to bless all our oranges via live stream. Our girls are always excited to offer up the oranges for blessing!&nbsp;</p>

<p>We kick off our commemoration of Ash Wednesday and Lent with informative displays. Students are invited to write a prayer for loved ones and also to perform an act of love for their friends, family or classmates. This year, we celebrated Easter with girls writing about what they were grateful for.&nbsp;</p>

</tbody>

<p>The girls also witness the symbolic act of the Washing of the Feet. Catholic students also participate in Lenten Penitential Services and the Stations of the Cross. They are guided to reflect on each station and relate it to their daily lives.</p>
<p>The Sacrament of Reconciliation (Confession) is scheduled for the Catholic girls during Lent, and made possible by the priests from the Serangoon District. Teachers guide students by providing questions for them to examine their conscience.</p>

<h4><strong>Project G.O.O.D (Gift of One Dollar)</strong></h4>
<p>Every year, we encourage students to put aside one dollar over the 40 days of Lent. The money that is collected is donated to IJHCC (Infant Jesus Homes and Children's Centres). In the past, we encouraged student leaders to rally their schoolmates to contribute their dollar. However, in 2020 and 2021, donations and collections were done in class to minimize intermingling.</p>
