Nurturing the value of the Catholic identity and ethos in our everyday school life provides guidance to our Catholic students.  These practices serve as the lifelong foundation, giving them meaning and purpose as they live a God-centred life.

Prayer is an integral part of our daily routine in school. Our Faith Ambassadors lead in prayer daily, at morning assembly, after recess as we sing a hymn of thanksgiving and later again at dismissal.
