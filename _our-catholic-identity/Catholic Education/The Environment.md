<p>We are a Catholic school and God&rsquo;s presence is all around. We believe that visual elements such as the crucifix, bible quotes, imagery and statues create a loving, peaceful and inspirational environment for our girls. The moment we enter the school driveway, we are greeted by the stained glass fa&ccedil;ade, a cross and a quote from Blessed Nicolas Barre.&nbsp;</p>
