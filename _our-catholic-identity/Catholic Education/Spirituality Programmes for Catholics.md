The Catholic parents of the school entrust their children to our care. We share the responsibility for the faith formation of our students. At IJ OLN, students are given the opportunity to know and experience God’s love, resting in the belief that God truly loves them.

Non-Catholic students are welcomed to join in these programmes. Parents can inform their children’s form teacher if they would like their children to do so.

On Wednesdays during the Values Education Lessons, Catholic students come together to learn about the teachings of Jesus Christ and how it impacts our day-to-day life. 

Do note that TLC Lessons do not replace Catechism lessons conducted by churches. The programme at church prepares children for the Sacraments of Communion, Reconciliation and Confirmation; TLC does not.

On the Holy Days of Obligation (Solemnity of the Ascension of the Lord, Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Solemnity of All Saints’ Day), masses are celebrated for Catholic students in the mornings at 7.00a.m before school starts.
