<p>Mother Mathilde was born Marie Justine Raclot in France in 1814, the first born and ony daughter of a&nbsp;family of farmers&nbsp;who were deeply religious.&nbsp;In her childhood, Justine learned much from her father who was kind to the poor especially those stranded without shelter in the severe cold of winter. She was shy and loved the beauty of the garden and the surrounding countryside. One of her childhood joys was to dress up her dolls as little nuns and she would visualise them going away on missionary journeys.</p>
<p>At an early age, Justine was already a prayerful child. At age 6, she went to a primary school and at the age of 12, her father recognising her need for a secondary education, sent her to a boarding school run by the IJ Sisters, who were then known as Dames of St Maur, in France.</p>
