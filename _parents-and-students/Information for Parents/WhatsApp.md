<h4><strong>WhatsApp Messaging System</strong></h4>
<p>To enhance our communication with parents/guardians, our school uses WhatsApp
Business alongside other communication channels.</p>
<p>Using our WhatsApp Business numbers, teachers will communicate with parents/guardians
via the regular WhatsApp application on your phones. There is no need to
install WhatsApp Business separately.</p>
<p>Please note that WhatsApp Business is one of several communication methods
we use. We also communicate through the School Organiser, our school general
office telephone numbers, and official school email addresses. Important
messages are also sent through Parents Gateway, so please ensure notification
function on Parents Gateway is enabled to receive alerts. These multiple
channels ensure that information reaches parents/guardians, providing alternative
options when needed.</p>
