<p style="text-align: left;">In CHIJ OLN, we believe that every girl is a sister to another girl and sisters care for each other. We enable each student to grow by caring for one another and learning to depend on each other for companionship and support. This allows our girls to live out our GRACIA values, especially Graciousness and Responsibility!</p>

<p>Our &lsquo;Sisterly Love&rsquo; programme pairs older girls with the younger ones, and encourages participation in a series of events throughout the year that allow both girls to know each other better. Both older sister and younger sister benefit as they love each other, and build yet another relationship that supports them through primary school. In turn, the younger sister will grow to be an older sister and the sisterly love cycle begins all over again!</p>
