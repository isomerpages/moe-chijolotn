<p><strong>CCA PROGRESSION FOR NETBALLERS<br /></strong>At Primary 2, students are talent-scouted by PE teachers. The coach works together with the PE teachers to select students who display potential based on their psychomotor skills, fitness, aptitude and attitude. Selected students will subsequently be invited to join the Netball CCA at Primary 3.</p>
<p>At the upper primary level, students train twice a week. The intensive training program is designed to provide our netballers with the relevant and necessary skills and knowledge to adequately prepare them for inter-school competitions and life. Before training, students will reflect on their short-term personal process goals. During training, fitness conditioning, drills, as well as understanding game play through set play strategies and game concept will be taught. At the end of each training, students will go through a debrief session with the coach. GRACIA values are highlighted to the students as they reflect on the day&rsquo;s training and learning points.</p>
