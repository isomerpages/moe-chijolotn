<p><strong>CCA PROGRESSION FOR NETBALLERS<br /></strong>At Primary 2, students are talent-scouted by PE teachers. The coach works together with the PE teachers to select students who display potential based on their psychomotor skills, fitness, aptitude and attitude. Selected students will subsequently be invited to join the Netball CCA at Primary 3.</p>
<p>At the upper primary level, students train twice a week. The intensive training program is designed to provide our netballers with the relevant and necessary skills and knowledge to adequately prepare them for inter-school competitions and life. Before training, students will reflect on their short-term personal process goals. During training, fitness conditioning, drills, as well as understanding game play through set play strategies and game concept will be taught. At the end of each training, students will go through a debrief session with the coach. GRACIA values are highlighted to the students as they reflect on the day&rsquo;s training and learning points.</p>

<p><strong>EXPOSURE TO COMPETITION</strong><br /><em>Our Primary 4 team participates in netball carnivals at the end of each year. Friendly matches with other schools are organized to gear them up for the inter-school competitions at Primary 5 and Primary 6. Our Primary 5 and 6 School Teams participate in the South Zone Netball Championships. The top 4 schools in each zone will then compete in the National Netball Championships.</em></p>
