<h2>Calling All Ex-CHIJ OLN students!</h2>
<p>This year marks a significant milestone for the CHIJ family as we commemorate
the 170th anniversary of the CHIJ Mission in Singapore. It is with great
joy that we invite you to join us in celebrating this occasion. The highlight
of our celebrations will be the gathering of the entire CHIJ fraternity
at the Singapore Sports Hub. Here, we will come together to celebrate the
IJ identity and legacy, offering our heartfelt gratitude to God for His
enduring mercy and blessings.</p>
<p>As part of our celebrations, we will also be expressing our thanks to
God for his love, guidance and support over the last 170 years and for
our IJ community of Sisters with a Thanksgiving Mass. We thank His Eminence,
William Cardinal Goh, who has agreed to grace the occasion as the main
celebrant.</p>
