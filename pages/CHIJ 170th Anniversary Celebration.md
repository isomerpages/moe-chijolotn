<h2>Calling All Ex-CHIJ OLN students!</h2>
<p>This year marks a significant milestone for the <strong>CHIJ family as we commemorate the 170th anniversary of the CHIJ Mission in Singapore</strong>.
It is with great joy that <strong>we invite you to join us in celebrating this occasion</strong>.
The highlight of our celebrations will be the gathering of the entire CHIJ
fraternity at the Singapore Sports Hub. Here, we will come together to
celebrate the IJ identity and legacy, offering our heartfelt gratitude
to God for His enduring mercy and blessings.</p>
<p>As part of our celebrations, we will also be expressing our thanks to
God for his love, guidance and support over the last 170 years and for
our IJ community of Sisters with a Thanksgiving Mass. We thank His Eminence,
William Cardinal Goh, who has agreed to grace the occasion as the main
celebrant.</p>
