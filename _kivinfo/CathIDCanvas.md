<p style="text-align: center;">We are a Catholic school and God’s presence is all around. We believe that visual elements such as the crucifix, bible quotes, images and statues create a loving, peaceful and inspirational environment for our students. The moment we approach the school, we are greeted by the stained-glass façade, a cross and a quote from Blessed Nicolas Barré.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">A  dedicated sacred space is available for all to use. In this calm and peaceful retreat, the students can pray and spend quiet time with God. 
Parent Volunteers supervise and guide the students daily as they spend time in prayer during recess. </p>

In the canteen, the ‘Prayer for Grace before Meals’ banner invites children to give thanks for the food they have been blessed with.
	
Bible verses and quotes from Nicolas Barré on the walls speak to us and inspire us to grow in our faith and trust in God.
	
In each classroom, crucifixes serve as a reminder of God’s presence. </p>
