<h4>1. The Mastery of Touch-Typing in Murasu Anjal</h4>
<p>To give our students an edge in typing of Tamil fonts, we have initiated the touch-typing programme for TL students from P1 to P6. The mastery of the Murasu Anjal fonts is a value-added activity where students become competent users of the Murasu Anjal software. This prepares our students for the C2015 student outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2. Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Fortnight week</h4>

<p>Students had a Learning Journey to the Ponggal Bazaar at Campbell Lane during the Harvest Festival. They visited stalls selling tidbits, essential items for the making of Ponggal and decoration materials so as to instill in them the festive mood. Our students also had the opportunity to see, touch and smell the ginger, turmeric and padi plant, touched the goats and watched cows chewed the cud.</p>
<h4>4. Combined IJ Schools Language and Cultural Camp</h4>
<p>Our Tamil department has been conducting this fun filled camp for more than a decade now. This camp is conducted with the objective of fostering camaraderie among our IJ girls. All six IJ schools collaborate to organize an enriching Language and Cultural camp for our students.</p>
<h4>5. Learning Journey to Masai Tamil Language School in Johor Bahru</h4>
<p>As part of our partnership for an immersion programme with an overseas school, we have been conducting our Learning Journey to Masai Tamil School in Johor Bahru since 2011.</p>
<p>Our students learn several traditional games during their visit there. They also have hands-on session on learning the traditional Johorian dance, Zapin. Zapin is a CCA in Masai Tamil School. The Learning Journey is an enriching experience for each and every student.</p>
