<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>The Malay Language department&rsquo;s goal is to promote the Malay Language as a life-long language. We aim to inculcate the language in our students through active and interactive methods with the aim of getting students to appreciate the language and its culture.</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to use the language effectively by creating an enjoyable classroom teaching and learning environment. This is done by exposing our students to class-discussions, singing, presenting, poetry recitation, story-telling and role-playing activities. Also, several key programmes have been planned for the students on a yearly basis.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li>Mother Tongue Language Fortnight Part 1 and 2</li>
<li>Combined IJ Schools Camp</li>
<li>Twinning Programme with Sekolah Kebangsaan Sri Bintang Utara</li>
<li>Malay Language Competitions</li>
</ol>

<p>The MTL Fortnight is an initiative started by MOE to provide opportunities for students in the learning and use of Malay Language outside the context of their daily academic lessons. A variety of engaging and exciting activities is being organized for the students. These activities provided them with platforms to use the Malay Language in authentic settings. Through the language games, dance workshops, competitions and cultural activities, students were able to enrich their vocabulary and enhance their writing and oral skills in a fun and meaningful way.</p>
